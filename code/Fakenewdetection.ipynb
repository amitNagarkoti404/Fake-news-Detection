statement about any American involved with Russian “help”::Beth dont you listen to Byron Its complicated   Byron Cohen and Flynn have pled guilty for lying about tacking to Russians about Trump business and affairs of state In the same time period the Russians were hacking and leaking to help Trump win Its not complicated::Actually they say that Flynn didn’t appear to be lying Not that he didn’t lie He simply didn’t present any indicators of deception Meaning he was a practiced liar::Bwaaaaahhaaaahhaaaa Read the 302s Find the transcripts of Comey’s first testimony and that of McCabe  They all say the same thing Flynn didn’t lie::No it says he didn’t look like he was lying They in fact did know that he was lying::Read the document again It clearly states the agents didnt think he way lying::You really just can’t admit all your “The FBI said he didn’t lie” takes were wrong can you::It’s known now that the agents who interviewed Gen Flynn originally stated that the General was being truthful Nice try though::What was the lie::Comey was quoted as saying he didnt think Flynn was lying it was being asked about something and not remembering::In the redacted 302 report Strzok and Pientka said they “both had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying”::Actually the agents said he did not appear to be lying which as A very seasoned 3 star lt general former director of defense intelligence agency  he knows all the signs to hide lying   They never said he didn’t lie::I thought the FBI said he didn’t lie from the beginning::Flynn not lying might have simplified things too::Why should how Flynn or the Trump admin be treated any differently than HRC was by the FBI::So his guilty plea proves that it’s impossible for the FBI to set him up Proves that the admin wasn’t spied on illegaly and confidential calls leaked to set him up::Keep telling yourself that::Unless you are HRC and then you can bring your 9 lawyers some of which are direct witnesses to the crime you are being investigated::Yes it is shocking federal investigators  use every tool at their disposal unless you’ve been paying attention since WWII::You can ONLY say that if the law was applied eventually Bill Clinton lies under oath and he wasn’t charged when he left office Dems lie under oath all the time All I want is equal treatment Don’t watch all the Dems skate then want the letter of the law applied here::Imagine if he would have never been illegally unmasked questioned under false pretenses and strong armed to plead guilty::Imagine how easy it

place::This pretty much shows how much the idiots on the Left know about facts just listening to FakeNewsMedia::Only with a time machine::Talking to Russian Ambassador Kyslyak became a crime by the Democrats ignoring the fact that Kyslyak visited Obamas WH 22 times during 20152016 according to WH visitors records  What was the Russian Ambassador doing at the WH then::Do you remember the date of the 2016 election Do you know that the call was made after the election Do you also understand that the call was normal for any incoming administration before inauguration  Be informed before you post your commentsHave a great weekend::John Kerry meeting with Iran would certainly bring questions about the Logan Act John Kerry has no legal authority at this time::Do you even timeline::I assume you’re referencing the Clinton campaign’s collusion with Russian intelligence to produce the Steele dossier fiction  Go on this is fascinating::Ask John Kerry::The only modern purpose of the Logan act is as pretense for federal law enforcement to investigate somebody Its very likely unconstitutional 1st amendment so no case will ever make it to court or the entire act will be overturned::How exactly is the Logan act working if the investigation was based on something that wasn’t a crime And the crime the person was ultimately charged with was not believed to be a crime by the agents who did the interview::Liberal logic Laws must be enforced only to conservatives If the law was being applied evenly why JohnKerry is not prosecuted for negotiating with Iran Yes Iran on 2018 What an hypocrite::Then explain why John Kerry isnt in handcuffs His was a BLATANT violation of the Logan Act PS Trump had already been elected::You are forgetting it was legal::Surely thereve many cases of the private diplomacy that the act seems intended to forbid but its never enforced Seems like a fossil of the early Republic like the Sedition Act Never actually repealed but deadletter law::Failed to indict John Kerry when he as a private citizen intervened with Iran and others to thwart Trumps foreign policy::Looks like for the most part it’s working::The Logan Act exists but only barely On the books for 219 years only 2 indictments both 19C no convictions And suddenly its the most important law of the law::Your not a very smart Bee::What about the contact was way after the election genius::Definition of liberals using “Whataboutism”  Do as I say not as I do::Yes what about this what about that  what about thus  that  Yea that::You mean like the president of the US telling the president of Russia hed have more flexibility to negotiate mussel defense after the election::You cant seriously be that daft  If Mueller or any prosecutor tried to charge anyone with violating the Logan act it would be laughed out of court particularly if that anyone was part of the incoming administration Be smarter::He got a break for cooperating  That’s pretty obvious::Of note Flynn is not charged with any underlying crime  If your assertion is correct why not::Dems believe 63 million Trump voters are Russian collaborators  Because of course Hillary was the Virgin Mary who protects pedophiles and fleeced Haiti of its money and children::Sarc alert What was particularly brilliant in the Russian hacking of our election is how they went about it They conspired so that Hillary bested Trump in the popular vote but Trump would win the electoral college Seems they know the Constitution better than many Americans::Bingo ergo Trumps constant refrain The fake news media is the greatest enemy of the American people I say the world::Just imagine the campaign finance violations between corrupt politicians and bought and paid for media Who knows we may live to see that connection proven in court Heres wishing::I go even further What has a bigger affect on elections  Phony FB stories or a mainstream media that is essentially the communication wing of the Democratic Party  Non stop negative coverage of Trump::Please explain how The Russians affected the outcome of the election Do you know anyone who changed their vote due to socalled Russian memes or youtube videos  I know I dont::Why should he tell two FBI sleuths about totally legit diplomatic calls He was answering in the context of collusion to steal the election::Why did he lie if everything was on the up  up::Why speak up if you are a total NPC and dont even know the most basic of facts The Flynn calls were 100 percent legal and moral::Whataboutism::Lets also assume the Logan act is a thing  Should JohnKerry be prosecuted  He has clearly violated the centuries old law ::Exactly I think that should be referred to the doj and FBI well maybe not they dont do a goddamn thing anyway only to Republicans::Didnt john Kerry just go to Iran to tell them wait 2 more years and trump will be out of office::oh I can play Hillary has lied 10000 times Obama 20000 times SC 7000 times Lynch 8000 times Comey 9000 times Rice 4000 times Holder 12000 times Liberal Media 1500000000000 times and counting::Well let’s see now Flynn lied once he lied twice he lied three times then came lie number four

claims a phone call that happened 7 weeks after helped steal an election::Fool  Ah I love a namecaller  It’s so Trumpian::Hey fool the call was almost 2 months after the election  The only people to conspire w Russia to affect the outcome of an election were Hillary and her gang of criminals::Not the same circumstances::What about John Kerry What about expresident carter All have broke the Logan Act  Yes getting a foreign power to effect the outcome of an election  But what’s you’re definition effect the election  Changing votes is about the only thing I would define::Just another communist bot::Liberal logic Laws must be enforced only to conservatives If the law was being applied evenly why JohnKerry is not prosecuted for negotiating with Iran Yes Iran on 2018 What an hypocrite::I can see the handwringing now when you folks have to determine what you’ll do when Trump is named as a coconspirator  Will you take to the streets in revolt as he maintains  Just curious::Oh poor sad Dave  Cant defend the facts about Trump so he makes up nonsense about Clinton and Obama  Here little baby Dave go back to the kids table GooGooGoo::Lets see rarely inforce considered unconstitutional anyway and Flynn nor Trump ever conspired to steal the election however Clinton and Obama did and committed treason as well::What about NBC  They tried to influence the election with access Hollywood tapes  But you won’t talk about that  What about the lies that the MSM push during the campaign::Everything in your comment is false Youre lying  Or maybe youre just ignorant But my moneys on the former::A negotiation by a private citizen to lift sanctions against Russia and give them a foothold in Syria in exchange for nothing Perhaps we should be talking treason in addition to the Logan Act::So assuming the Logan Act doesnt exist it would be okay to conspire with the Russians to effect the outcome of an election  Whoa thats AntiAmerican to the extreme::You are right you dont get it Try a little harder::no one has ever been convicted under the Logan act it is a joke a hoax and a pretense of a reason to trap Flynn::And Obamas world tour once he became a private citizen going everywhere Trump went to undermine US foreign policy::What I dont get is why is Logan act brought up for Flynn but not brought up for others like John Kerry who has gone around doing his own negotiations with governments   There seems to be a bizarre double standard here  it should be resolved one way or the other::Mike Flynn is a progressive::Byron  stop confusing the progressive mafia with     facts::Bingo::He could think of something He could say they wanted to get other details about that a transcript wouldnt have Tone of voice things like that That wouldnt be very believable but he could just say it was a judgement call::But Mueller cant just say So I could entrap Flynn What reason can he give that wont open him up to prosecution for misconduct::So they could entrap him::If they already had a transcript why did they need to ask Flynn what he talked about::Did he really::Would have been even less complicated if Flynn hadnt lied::Flynn served this nation with distinction for 33 years of his life Your comment just shows how the liberal media is a propaganda machine poisoning Americans with lies This is what the Nazis did to Jews in Germany vilifyslander them 247 to where they no longer seemed humane::This whole Michael Flynn thing would have been less complicated if only he wasn’t a criminal::What was the specific lie::Or if Michael Flynn had just not you know lied ::Will someone please tell me what the lie was::The whole Michael Flynn thing would have been much less complicated if Flynn hadnt lied to the FBI   Therefixed it Much simplershorter::Put the crack pipe down::The only lie is coming out of the FBI and Mueller  Mueller didn’t meet deadline to give Judge Sullivan the requested 302s  This is great  Mueller  his DEM cabal going down Tuesday for their coup d’etat attempt::Why are you so insistent on making excuses for people who commit national security crimes Flynn lied to the FBI of his own volition He plotted to kidnap a US resident of his own volition No one made him::Suggest you look up entrapment::Entrapment::Mobsters and Wall Street fraudsters Not when ur questioning the national security advisor about such an insignificant conversation::There is such a thing as ruthless bothersome unpleasant and legitimate::He threatened to charge them with lying to the FBI if they didnt flip on the Capo Di Tutti No wonder he was able to turn them 10 days in jail vs death Easy choice::Flipping witnesses is how Giuliani built his career though::Kind of like enforcing border laws and illegal immigration huh::It also would be much less complicated if flaccid Quislings like you did not intentionally creating the appearance of complication begrudging law enforcement doing its job of enforcing the law and bringing violators aka “criminals” to account::50 million acquired from Manafort guilty verdicts  pleas  paid for this investigative with more months paid in spades::And less expensive for the American people for goodness sakes::Right Kinda thought not Because working for the President within the White House on National Security requires talking to Russian  oh also Iranians which is why Ben Rhodes isnt in jail Nor am I

accepted gifts kept their jobs you are naive  Buckle up Horowitz knows more He has access to all the documents Remember when Trump gave them to him::Nope Nothing but the Aug 22 302 McCabes notes are illuminating in that it is clear that Flynn knows his conversation was heard and that the FBI knows everything he said It also documents Flynns concern this leaked to the media Hard to see Flynn lying re Kislyak::Great Can you provide Strzoks notes from the meeting too::McCabes contemporaneous notes on setting up Flynn meeting::It would be nice to see the contemporaneously written FBI notes instead of an interview of Strzok 7 months later  a week before removal from an investigation and year before being fired::It’s true::No one made Flynn LIE   A nasty habit of Flynn’s which was why Trump fired him right::Isn’t it a legit question::How do you railroad a military man who has spent his life supposedly upholding the laws of my country Just who did he take an oath to anyway::Just answer this If they already had a transcript why did they need to ask Flynn what he talked about::Dont lie to the FBI Dont break the law Seems simple Yet trump cult members cant make sense of it The irony Lock them

interview::If I imagine all the ways the Clintons have gotten away with murder literally then my worst fears about shadow power in our country come to life and I’m made physically ill::Actually Hillary didn’t need a Lawyer when talking with the FBI  they had already decided she was not guilty of anything::This Imagine could just go on and on with the logical conclusion that it would trap her Luckily they didnt do that right::Yeah didnt she have like 5 lawyers with her::I wouldnt even be satisfied with that Real justice Let history remember the Clintons and their lackeys for their crimes against humanity and treason::There’s something highly contemptible about a man who blindly follows every whim of a demon of a man as though he were a mob boss threatens journalists pays off porn

you didnt come clean sooner  It would have saved you a lot of heartache  But thanking for stepping forward telling the world about the mega liar  Hope trump comes down much much harder than you did::You willingly took his money so you signed up for it::We know he lies You are the fall guy Sorry::So this all over now  Why wouldn’t there be a gag order in place  I thought a prosecutor wouldn’t want info out on a continuing investigation  Plus simply put Cohen is a rat::Sweet attempt to humanize this convicted felon What incentive does he have to be honest now None Zero skin in game at this point Cold blooded liar::Cohen was arrested for charges unrelated to Trump::That is sad  I really do believe Trump pretended to be a father figure so that he could use him like a dirty rag to wipe up his messes  When Cohen attempted to elevate himself Trump let him know how badly he used him calling him dumb and then threw him away like so much trash::The only thing I could think is Mr Mueller is done with his investigations and is getting ready to drop the final verdict But I agree something isn’t correct::Why is Mueller allowing Cohen to publicly discuss his case Wouldnt Mueller want for him to maintain silence as he proceeds with his investigation of Trump::Youve been suckered dry::I wouldve believe that but I cant The uranium deal is being covered up with this false investigation You know the thing that goes boom on top a ballistic missile or concocted into a dirty bomb That now Iran has and despises USA and Israel Go ahead and feel the hatred::I beg to differ  trump is the dirty critter in all of this baloney of a presidency::Very interesting how a guy can talk about a case under investigation Oh wait a lawyer The more they keep it and repeat it The more people will believe it Instead of investigating Muellers involvement with uranium 1 transfer to the Russians Diversion from the deep within::I dont I NEVER believed what Trump was saying I dont need a DESPICABLE ENABLING

told us he does not see anything wrong with lying to reports::He has a right to free representation He is only bankrupting himself::He doesnt deserve punishment for being coerced in to pleading guilty

this particular case::Byron have any of your sources indicated if theres even an investigation on who leaked this highly classified info::Any chance it was McCabe who leaked it He leaked and approved other leaks so it could fit a pattern of behavior::Transcript says Mr Trump Junior and Senior are in deep deep doo doo::Goodness::Wasn’t all of that leaked by Republicans trying to discredit the investigation::Its unsolved because nobody is investigating it::That sadly nobody seems to be trying to solve ::Because the people responsible for enforcing the law are the ones that did it::Smells like Brennan::Exactly  Hope Sullivan’s see’s through the Mueller Madness and acts accordingly to make it “right”::Felony::Not to mention the felony revealed means and methods to the Russian Ambassador thus actually hurting investigation of Russian influence to prove Flynn did not conduct collusion  Madness::Who says it’s unsolved Byron  Maybe prosecutors know who the culprit was and are merely exercising prosecutorial discretion  The culprit should have confidentially reported the matter to proper authorities instead of creating TrumpRussia hysteria::Are you whispering “Obama”::Byron Does anyone know what the exact directive was to the two agents who went and interviewed flynn I mean if it was in pursuit of a criminal indictment they would’ve needed to mirandized himright::BYRON  HOW DO YOU THINK THE CORRUPT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SPENT 105 MILLION   LETS CHECK WITH DEUTSCH BANK::If the transcripts would have hurt Flynn they would have been released by now::When the story first broke Brooke Baldwin from CNN said she saw the transcripts and said Flynn did not speak specifically about sanctions Kislyak asked about them Flynn didnt respond but said well talk after the inauguration in January::Sally Yates for the win SallyQYates   Disgusting witch::The serious crimes of leaking and unmasking are unsolved because they are uninvestigated by DOJ  DeepState has no partucular interest in prosecution in pursuit of Justice only in protecting its friends and destroying its enemies::Where is the audio of the call  Transcripts are transcribed incorrectly all the time FOX transcribed Trump talking about his strong “face” instead of what he actually said  “base” Also transcriptions don’t record speakers inflection tone call quality interruptions etc::I think a prerequisit to calling it unsolved is that it is under investigation  That is not clear::I put 100 on Samantha Power 50 on Brennan or Yates as the leaker They could find out if they “really” wanted too::Laws are for the little people And you mere citizens would do well to remember that  Every waking minute of every day::do we know for certain it was a crime  Could it have been leaked by someone with a legal right to do it  We have seen the laws are written to give the IC all kinds of room to be evil::Citizen editior  Uninvestigated  You would have to investigate first before it could be described as unsolved to your reader  Otherwise it is misleading ::Yes indeed::You MZHemingway seanmdav are constantly pushing through the noise please continue the excellent work You 3 represent the definition of world class journalists::That story about Comey saying Flynn didn’t lie may deserve the title of Most Persistent Zombie Lie of 2018   I thought that the stories about the Trump Tower meeting were robust but this one seems to be even stronger::Such an insignicant looking man  Looks like a high school teacher   Bastard::Just following orders is a recurring plea frequently used to justify an atrocity::I was a child when he was arrested Thanks for the detailed background Chilling::Eichmanns trial before a special tribunal of the Jerusalem District Court began on 11 April 1961 The legal basis of the charges against him was the 1950 Nazi and Nazi Collaborators Punishment Law under which he was indicted on 15 criminal charges::Was his death sentence carried out::There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders Eichmann wrote I was not a responsible leader and as such do not feel myself guilty::Inspector Less noted that Eichmann did not seem to realize the enormity of his crimes and showed no remorse::When additional information was brought forward that forced him into admitting what he had done Eichmann would insist he had no authority in the Nazi hierarchy and was only following orders::Its called a perjury trap and the old carp Mueller is a master of the disgusting practice::The judge is going to dismiss the charges::So basically if my grade went up 046 I would’ve received a 40 GPA and not a 30 GPA I have this professor for 34 of my main classes this

of his golden years behind bars::to the negotiation reported by Trump campaign advisor  former CIA director James Woolsey where Flynn  his son were working on a deal to kidnap Turkish cleric living in US on political asylum and fly him back to Turkey for 15 million and the RussianSaudi reactor deal he was::likely charges of conspiracy vs US serious FARA violations for not disclosing he was on Turkish Government payroll throughout campaign  transition and paid in multiple single instances by Russian govt during that time as well as well as possible additional charges related::That is what I don’t understand Seems like it would have been clear::Rumor has it that the FBI uttered paraphrases of Flynn’s recording and expected Flynn to respond “That’s not true”  But Flynn offered no response and they pounced because he failed to refute for which he had no obligation::Yeah this isnt how it works The information that was leaked was already known to the government It was leaked to the public and the leaker could face charges However it in no way makes Flynn innocent Also he lied on federal forms and lied in later interviews::Do you have the order id that we can have a look at Feel free to

youre entitled to it::He’s guilty as sin::I disagree I think they caught the murderer and secured a conviction::This whole case was negligent The real criminals are the investigators and the

cites 4 lies in this article::Does someone have a link that addresses what Flynn lies about And why he might go rogue::DOJ prob’ly wanted to believe Flynn based on service record gave him benefit of the doubt probably hoping he could somehow explain but that transcript was damning and additional evidence put paid to his lies Remember Sally Yates  Obama admin already had warned against Flynn::Based on what you said above this is not a logical conclusion::The 302s indicated they didnt think he was lying So I guess they judged him credible::Ok so the claim is that they went there to judge his credibility His past military and govt exp conferred none on him at that point Fine Also are you admitting that they were looking for leverage::Its a law enforcement tactic  You ask questions some of which you already know the answer  This allows you to judge credibility and intent as well as collect more info  It also gives you leverage if the person lies::So you don’t think he registered as a foreign agent months before Mueller was even investigating This is a real thing Do I need to post the forms He literally admitted this in court filings as well::Mueller just released a 302 on Flynn that was produced 7 months after his interview not the original Mueller has nothing on anyone and Flynn will likely end up pardoned::Also some of the forms submitted to the court are

basis of the direction of the case Move forward or abandon::As far as I can see there are two paragraphs missing from the front::Lol It will come out eventually Unsealed when the other investigations are done The judge and investigators are Republican::Do you know what entrapment is::Hmm no justice here This is text book entrapment Unfortunate that the only chance for the truth to come out is a

Q did you know flynn plead guilty::He didnt deny calling him It was about the substance of the conversation::I’m just guessing but I’d imagine it was something like phone records that proved that

statement about any American involved with Russian “help”::Beth dont you listen to Byron Its complicated   Byron Cohen and Flynn have pled guilty for lying about tacking to Russians about Trump

didn’t lie He simply didn’t present any indicators of deception Meaning he was a practiced liar::Bwaaaaahhaaaahhaaaa Read the 302s Find the transcripts of Comey’s first testimony and that of McCabe  They all say the same thing Flynn didn’t lie::No it says he didn’t look like he was lying They in fact did know that he was lying::Read the document again It clearly states the agents didnt think he way lying::You really just can’t admit all your “The FBI said he didn’t lie” takes were wrong can you::It’s known now that the agents who interviewed Gen Flynn originally stated that the General was being truthful Nice try though::What was the lie::Comey was quoted as saying he didnt think Flynn was lying it was being asked about something and not remembering::In the redacted 302 report Strzok and Pientka said they “both had the impression at the time that Flynn was not lying or did not think he was lying”::Actually the agents said he did not appear to be lying which as A very seasoned 3 star lt general former director of defense intelligence agency  he knows all the signs to hide lying   They never said he didn’t lie::I thought the FBI said he didn’t lie from the beginning::Flynn not lying might have simplified things too::Why should how Flynn or the Trump admin be treated any differently than HRC was by the FBI::So his guilty plea proves that it’s impossible for the FBI to set him up Proves that the admin wasn’t spied on illegaly and confidential calls leaked to set him up::Keep telling yourself that::Unless you are HRC and then you can bring your 9 lawyers some of which are direct witnesses to the crime you are being investigated::Yes it is shocking federal investigators  use every tool at their disposal unless you’ve been paying attention since WWII::You can ONLY say that if the law was applied eventually Bill Clinton lies under oath and he wasn’t charged when he left office Dems lie under oath all the time All I want is equal treatment Don’t watch all the Dems skate then want the letter of the law applied here::Imagine if he would have never been illegally unmasked questioned under false pretenses and strong armed to plead guilty::Imagine how easy it would have been if Michael Flynn hadnt lied to the FBI::What crime The Logan act Pull the other one there’s political ambush bells on it::Even betterjust don’t commit the crime Then you really won’t have to lie::You may not respect the rule of law but I do Bye::He didnt lie it was a perjury trap  The FBI refused to hand over the 302 record of the interview even though the judge presiding over all of this ordered Mueller to do so by yesterday You are attacking the victim in this::I find that not lying to law enforcement is generally a good way to stay out of trouble Just sayin::Not what he said

place::This pretty much shows how much the idiots on the Left know about facts just listening to FakeNewsMedia::Only with a time machine::Talking to Russian Ambassador Kyslyak became a crime by the Democrats ignoring the fact that Kyslyak visited Obamas WH 22 times during 20152016 according to WH visitors records  What was the Russian Ambassador doing at the WH then::Do you remember the date of the 2016 election Do you know that the call was made after the election Do you also understand that the call was normal for any incoming administration before inauguration  Be informed before you post your commentsHave a great weekend::John Kerry meeting with Iran would certainly bring questions about the Logan Act John Kerry has no legal authority at this time::Do you even timeline::I assume you’re referencing the Clinton campaign’s collusion with Russian intelligence to produce the Steele dossier fiction  Go on this is fascinating::Ask John Kerry::The only modern purpose of the Logan act is as pretense for federal law enforcement to investigate somebody Its very likely unconstitutional 1st amendment so no case will ever make it to court or the entire act will be overturned::How exactly is the Logan act working if the investigation was based on something that wasn’t a crime And the crime the person was ultimately charged with was not believed to be a crime by the agents who did the interview::Liberal logic Laws must be enforced only to conservatives If the law was being applied evenly why JohnKerry is not prosecuted for negotiating with Iran Yes Iran on 2018 What an hypocrite::Then explain why John Kerry isnt in handcuffs His was a BLATANT violation of the Logan Act PS Trump had already been elected::You are forgetting it was legal::Surely thereve many cases of the private diplomacy that the act seems intended to forbid but its never enforced Seems like a fossil of the early Republic like the Sedition Act Never actually repealed but deadletter law::Failed to indict John Kerry when he as a private citizen intervened with Iran and others to thwart Trumps foreign policy::Looks like for the most part it’s working::The Logan Act exists but only barely On the books for 219 years only 2 indictments both 19C no convictions And suddenly its the most important law of the law::Your not a very smart Bee::What about the contact was way after the election genius::Definition of liberals using “Whataboutism”  Do as I say not as I do::Yes what about this what about that  what about thus  that  Yea that::You mean like the president of the US telling the president of Russia hed have more flexibility to negotiate mussel defense after the election::You cant seriously be that daft  If Mueller or any prosecutor tried to charge anyone with violating the Logan act it would be laughed out of court particularly if that anyone was part of the incoming administration Be smarter::He got a break for cooperating  That’s pretty obvious::Of note Flynn is not charged with any underlying crime  If your assertion is correct why not::Dems believe 63 million Trump voters are Russian collaborators  Because of course Hillary was the Virgin Mary who protects pedophiles and fleeced Haiti of its money and children::Sarc alert What was particularly brilliant in the Russian hacking of our election is how they went about it They conspired so that Hillary bested Trump in the popular vote but Trump would win the electoral college Seems they know the Constitution better than many Americans::Bingo ergo Trumps constant refrain The fake news media is the greatest enemy of the American people I say the world::Just imagine the campaign finance violations between corrupt politicians and bought and paid for media Who knows we may live to see that connection proven in court Heres wishing::I go even further What has a bigger affect on elections  Phony FB stories or a mainstream media that is essentially the communication wing of the Democratic Party  Non stop negative coverage of Trump::Please explain how The Russians affected the outcome of the election Do you know anyone who changed their vote due to socalled Russian memes or youtube videos  I know I dont::Why should he tell two FBI sleuths about totally legit diplomatic calls He was answering in the context of collusion to steal the election::Why did he lie if everything was on the up  up::Why speak up if you are a total NPC and dont even know the most basic of facts The Flynn calls were 100 percent legal and moral::Whataboutism::Lets also assume the Logan act is a thing  Should JohnKerry be prosecuted  He has clearly violated the centuries old law ::Exactly I think that should be referred to the doj and FBI well maybe not they dont do a goddamn thing anyway only to Republicans::Didnt john Kerry just go to Iran to tell them wait 2 more years and trump will be out of office::oh I can play Hillary has lied 10000 times Obama 20000 times SC 7000 times Lynch 8000 times Comey 9000 times Rice 4000 times Holder 12000 times Liberal Media 1500000000000 times and counting::Well let’s see now Flynn lied once he lied twice he lied three times then came lie number four  Then Trump has lied 6000 times  I’m good where I am with SCO SDNY  Constitutional Conservatism::just following you::Think you may be using alternative facts::What else would you call someone who claims a phone call that happened 7 weeks after helped steal an election::Fool  Ah I love a namecaller  It’s so Trumpian::Hey fool the call was almost 2 months after the election  The only people to conspire w Russia to affect the outcome of an election were Hillary and her gang of criminals::Not the same circumstances::What about John Kerry What about expresident carter All have broke the Logan Act  Yes getting a foreign power to effect the outcome of an election  But what’s you’re definition effect the election  Changing votes is about the only thing I would define::Just another communist bot::Liberal logic Laws must be enforced only to conservatives If the law was being applied evenly why JohnKerry is not prosecuted for negotiating with Iran Yes Iran on 2018 What an hypocrite::I can see the handwringing now when you folks have to determine what you’ll do when Trump is named as a coconspirator  Will you take to the streets in revolt as he maintains  Just curious::Oh poor sad Dave  Cant defend the facts about Trump so he makes up nonsense about Clinton and Obama  Here little baby Dave go back to the kids table GooGooGoo::Lets see rarely inforce considered unconstitutional anyway and Flynn nor Trump ever conspired to steal the election however Clinton and Obama did and committed treason as well::What about NBC  They tried to influence the election with access Hollywood tapes  But you won’t talk about that  What about the lies that the MSM push during the campaign::Everything in your comment is false Youre lying  Or maybe youre just ignorant But my moneys on the former::A negotiation by a private citizen to lift sanctions against Russia and give them a foothold in Syria in exchange for nothing Perhaps we should be talking treason in addition to the Logan Act::So assuming the Logan Act doesnt exist it would be okay to conspire with the Russians to effect the outcome of an election  Whoa thats AntiAmerican to the extreme::You are right you dont get it Try a little harder::no one has ever been convicted under the Logan act it is a joke a hoax and a pretense of a reason to trap Flynn::And Obamas world tour once he became a private citizen going everywhere Trump went to undermine US foreign policy::What I dont get is why is Logan act brought up for Flynn but not brought up for others like John Kerry who has gone around doing his own negotiations with governments   There seems to be a bizarre double standard here  it should be resolved one way or the other::Mike Flynn is a progressive::Byron  stop confusing the progressive mafia with     facts::Bingo::He could think of something He could say they wanted to get other details about that a transcript wouldnt have Tone of voice things like that That wouldnt be very believable but he could just say it was a judgement call::But Mueller cant just say So I could entrap Flynn What reason can he give that wont open him up to prosecution for misconduct::So they could entrap him::If they already had a transcript why did they need to ask Flynn what he talked about::Did he really::Would have been even less complicated if Flynn hadnt lied::Flynn served this nation with distinction for 33 years of his life Your comment just shows how the liberal media is a propaganda machine poisoning Americans with lies This is what the Nazis did to Jews in Germany vilifyslander them 247 to where they no longer seemed humane::This whole Michael Flynn thing would have been less complicated if only he wasn’t a criminal::What was the specific lie::Or if Michael Flynn had just not you know lied ::Will someone please tell me what the lie was::The whole Michael Flynn thing would have been much less complicated if Flynn hadnt lied to the FBI   Therefixed it Much simplershorter::Put the crack pipe down::The only lie is coming out of the FBI and Mueller  Mueller didn’t meet deadline to give Judge Sullivan the requested 302s  This is great  Mueller  his DEM cabal going down Tuesday for their coup d’etat attempt::Why are you so insistent on making excuses for people who commit national security crimes Flynn lied to the FBI of his own volition He plotted to kidnap a US resident of his own volition No one made him::Suggest you look up entrapment::Entrapment::Mobsters and Wall Street fraudsters Not when ur questioning the national security advisor about such an insignificant

point Cold blooded liar::Cohen was arrested for charges unrelated to Trump::That is sad  I really do believe Trump pretended to be a father figure so that he could use him like a dirty rag to wipe up his messes  When Cohen attempted to elevate himself Trump let him know how badly he used him calling him dumb and then threw him away like so much trash::The only thing I could think is Mr Mueller is done with his investigations and is getting ready to drop the final verdict But I agree something isn’t correct::Why is Mueller allowing Cohen to publicly discuss his case Wouldnt Mueller want for him to maintain silence as he proceeds with his investigation of Trump::Youve been suckered dry::I wouldve believe that but I cant The uranium deal is being covered up with this false investigation You

inauguration in January::Sally Yates for the win SallyQYates   Disgusting witch::The serious crimes of leaking and unmasking are unsolved because they are uninvestigated by DOJ  DeepState has no partucular interest in prosecution in pursuit of Justice only in protecting its friends and destroying its enemies::Where is the audio of the call  Transcripts are transcribed incorrectly all the time FOX transcribed Trump talking about his strong “face” instead of what he actually said  “base” Also transcriptions don’t record speakers inflection tone call quality interruptions etc::I think a prerequisit to calling it unsolved is that it is under investigation  That is not clear::I put 100 on Samantha Power 50 on Brennan or Yates as the leaker They could find out if they “really” wanted too::Laws are for the little people And you mere citizens would do well to remember that  Every waking minute of every day::do we know for certain it was a crime  Could it have been leaked by someone

need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders Eichmann wrote I was not a responsible leader and as such do not feel myself guilty::Inspector Less noted that Eichmann did not seem to realize the enormity of his crimes and showed no remorse::When additional information was brought forward that forced him into admitting what he had done Eichmann would insist he had no authority in the Nazi hierarchy and was only following orders::Its called a perjury trap and the old carp Mueller is a master of the disgusting practice::The judge is going to dismiss the charges::So basically if my grade went up 046 I would’ve received a 40 GPA and not a 30 GPA I have this professor for 34 of my main classes this

Turkish Government payroll throughout campaign  transition and paid in multiple single instances by Russian govt during that time as well as well as possible additional charges related::That is what I don’t understand Seems like it would have been clear::Rumor has it that the FBI uttered paraphrases of Flynn’s recording and expected Flynn to respond “That’s not true”  But Flynn offered no response and they pounced because he failed to refute for which he had no obligation::Yeah this isnt how it works The information that was leaked was already known to the government It was leaked to the public

Flynn::Based on what you said above this is not a logical conclusion::The 302s indicated they didnt think he was lying So I guess they judged him credible::Ok so the claim is that they went there to judge his credibility His past military and govt exp conferred none on him at that point Fine Also are you admitting that they were looking for leverage::Its a law enforcement tactic  You ask questions some of which you already know the answer  This allows you to judge credibility and intent as well as collect more info  It also gives you leverage if the person lies::So you don’t think he registered as a foreign agent months before Mueller was even investigating This is a real thing Do I need to post the forms He literally admitted this in court filings as well::Mueller just released a

anymore and settle on a shot of a breezeblock wall::It’s all about distraction with Colin::Your team can test different ideasand evolve without fear of topdown enforcement as long as they are delivering what they need to at the right quality level  Trivial decisions like how you name your variables put through a topdown process and enforced via lint sucks::If you have different code styles or even different languages so be it As long as it respects the integration format they can work together  How is this beneficial longterm::Lets bring this down to a specific codebase level  How your files come together should be well defined How those individual components that make up your system should be welldefined  But   How those individual components are constructed is inconsequential::They apply theirs to architectural design and youll see that it ended up setting standards around how pieces integrate together but the construct or behavior of each individual piece was left up to the team::You have to be man or woman enough to accept it and of capable of free thinking as that information is being presented to you It seems like youre going to have  problems::Strzok HAD THE TRANSCRIPT right in front of him to compare with Flynns answers Nothing Flynn said in the call was illegal The setup was shelved until Mueller resurrected it months later  a

are saying You had no idea of the points I made All you can say is nothing matters except your fake Russia collusion witch hunt Youd rather endorse corruption when it suits your agenda U got nothing DISMISSED pal::It was legal and customary to record all conversations with Russian ambassador It was not and should not be appropriate for a non government official to discuss foreign policy with him prior to assuming office Especially if the discussion is counter to US policy::Youre defending spying on Americans while monitoring call with Russian ambassador ILLEGALLY unmasking him leaking call to the press then setting a trap without telling him he was being officially interrogated in a phony investigation of Russia collusion Third world stuff::How does someone’s immediate reaction to a conversation prove whether or not he was lying That’s ridiculous Are you sure this is the hill you want to die on::Just know I will be fighting the bureaucracy Keep y’all updated ::So Flynn knew he lying and did it anyway  Dont go into law::I refer you to Eichmanns notes::No::also the earth is flat amirite::Where and when No war time record of gassing has ever been found — and not for lack of looking::So why does Eichmann mention gassed bodies in his own notes::I never said it was a crime It’s against Twitter rules though::Nice try Questioning the holocaust is not a crime yet in the US

PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments. Free Wood Post will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.Source: http://www.freewoodpost.com/2013/05/05/nra-president-jim-porter-its-only-a-matter-of-time-before-we-can-own-colored-people-again/PUBLIC NOTE: The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own and do not reflect the view of the Urban Intellectuals, affiliates or partners. -- ADVERTISEMENT -- DO YOU AGREE OUR HISTORY IS IMPORTANT?

In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.</td>\n",

This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.As the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.Witness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. “I didn’t have a gun on me but wish I did” pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa — ᏢᏒᎥsᏟᎥᏞᏞᎪ’s ᏉᎥᎬᎳ ™️ (@PriscillasView) April 3, 2018“When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, “I knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.”The witness also added, “I didn’t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.”He said he wished he had a gun. And that’s the way he should feel. And that’s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm. And no, they didn’t just mean muskets like you liberals keep trying to tell us. ‘Wow.. they will run this poor man out of looney California! — al_waisman (@al_waisman) April 4, 2018Reports are confirming that this particular shooting was just a disgruntled woman who wanted to kill her boyfriend, which would potentially make the event a case of domestic violence. And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.California is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50’s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.I am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms… they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that’s all.The shooter has now been identified via ABC 30SAN BRUNO, Calif. — Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.Aghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.Sources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.According to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.Police and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.She embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube “Ad-apocalypse” where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.Neistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.It appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform. She wrote on her website, “Be aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term profits and do anything to reach their goals even by fooling simple-minded people, hiding the truth, manipulating science and everything, putting public mental and physical health at risk, abusing non-human animals, polluting the environment, destroying family values, promoting materialism and sexual degeneration in the name of freedom and turning people into programmed robots!”She goes on to quote Adolf Hitler saying, “Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it and eventually they will believe it.”The rest of her message targets YouTube and censorship. “There is no free speech in the real world and you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not supported by the system. Videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated so that people can hardly see their videos.”February 20, YouTube enacted a new advertising policy that demonetized channels with less than 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time. Though Aghdam’s main English channel had more than 15,000 subscribers, many of her videos appeared to be demonetized.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. It’s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law &amp; Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. I’m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm, he says as he plows toward the ballroom.Inside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson’s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable womana former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband’s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.The room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson scripta bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. I was telling one of my buddies up there, You know, it’s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.’ And he says, Well, don’t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.’ Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. And then he says, Thompson, you got it all covered.’ Everyone laughs.Today, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. We can’t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We’ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can’t prove they’re terrorists within 24 hours, you’ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain’t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.Someone shouts Go, Fred, go.Now it’s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. People talk about the last election. They say, The war, the war, the war,’ Thompson says with a sigh. I think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it’s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made partnership with the alligators instead.A minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. Maybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues. The applause builds to a standing ovation. You know, I had another comment or two, Thompson says, but I think that’s the perfect place to stop.Thompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. You know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete, Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. Without raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I’ve already saved $50 million this year. Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.Since announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson’s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn’t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Supreme Court Case: Flemming vs. NestorBackground to the Case:The fact that workers contribute to the Social Security program's funding through a dedicated payroll tax establishes a unique connection between those tax payments and future benefits. More so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish \"rights\" to certain government services. This is often expressed in the idea that Social Security benefits are \"an earned right.\" This is true enough in a moral and political sense. But like all federal entitlement programs, Congress can change the rules regarding eligibility--and it has done so many times over the years. The rules can be made more generous, or they can be made more restrictive. Benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn, as for example with student benefits, which were substantially scaled-back in the 1983 Amendments.There has been a temptation throughout the program's history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal, contractual sense. That is to say, if a person makes FICA contributions over a number of years, Congress cannot, according to this reasoning, change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit. Under this reasoning, benefits under Social Security could probably only be increased, never decreased, if the Act could be amended at all. Congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law. Section 1104 of the 1935 Act, entitled \"RESERVATION OF POWER,\" specifically said: \"The right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to the Congress.\" Even so, some have thought that this reservation was in some way unconstitutional. This is the issue finally settled by Flemming v. Nestor.In this 1960 Supreme Court decision Nestor's denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving benefits. Under a 1954 law, Social Security benefits were denied to persons deported for, among other things, having been a member of the Communist party. Accordingly, Mr. Nestor's benefits were terminated. He appealed the termination arguing, among other claims, that promised Social Security benefits were a contract and that Congress could not renege on that contract. In its ruling, the Court rejected this argument and established the principle that entitlement to Social Security benefits is not contractual right. Flemming V. Nestor Case Name: FLEMMING V. NESTOR 363 U.S. 603 NO. 54. ARGUED FEBRUARY 24, 1960. - DECIDED JUNE 20, 1960. - 169 F. SUPP. 922, REVERSED . THE TERMINATION OF OLD-AGE BENEFITS PAYABLE TO AN ALIEN WHO, AFTER THE DATE OF ITS ENACTMENT (SEPTEMBER 1, 1954), IS DEPORTED UNDER SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT ON ANY ONE OF CERTAIN GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N). APPELLEE, AN ALIEN WHO HAD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN 1955, WAS DEPORTED IN 1956, PURSUANT TO SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. SINCE THIS WAS ONE OF THE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N), HIS OLD-AGE BENEFITS WERE TERMINATED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. HE COMMENCED THIS ACTION IN A SINGLE JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, UNDER SEC. 205(G) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, TO SECURE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THAT ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD THAT SEC. 202(N) DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT AND, THEREFORE, VIOLATED THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. HELD: 1. ALTHOUGH THIS ACTION DREW INTO QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N), IT DID NOT INVOLVE AN INJUNCTION OR OTHERWISE INTERDICT THE OPERATION OF THE STATUTORY SCHEME; 28 U.S.C.

PP. 606-608. 2.

(A) THE NONCONTRACTUAL INTEREST OF AN EMPLOYEE COVERED BY THE ACT CANNOT BE SOUNDLY ANALOGIZED TO THAT OF THE HOLDER OF AN ANNUITY, WHOSE RIGHTS TO BENEFITS ARE BASED ON HIS CONTRACTUAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS. PP. 608-610. (B) TO ENGRAFT UPON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM A CONCEPT OF \"ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHTS\" WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER-CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS AND WHICH CONGRESS PROBABLY HAD IN MIND WHEN IT EXPRESSLY RESERVED THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION OF THE ACT.

III, SEC. 2, CL. 3, OF THE CONSTITUTION OR THE SIXTH AMENDMENT; NOR IS SEC. 202(N) A BILL OF ATTAINDER OR EX POST FACTO LAW, SINCE ITS PURPOSE IS NOT PUNITIVE. PP. 612-621. FLEMMING , SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE, V. NESTOR . APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. MR. JUSTICE HARLAN DELIVERED THE OPINON OF THE COURT. FROM A DECISION OF THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOLDING SEC. 202(N) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (68 STAT. 1083, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(N)) UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE TAKES THIS DIRECT APPEAL PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. SEC. 1252. THE CHALLENGED SECTION, SET FORTH IN FULL IN THE MARGIN, (FN1) PROVIDES FOR THE TERMINATION OF OLD-AGE, SURVIVOR, AND DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS PAYABLE TO, OR IN CERTAIN CASES IN RESPECT OF, AN ALIEN INDIVIDUAL WHO, AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 1954 (THE DATE OF ENACTMENT OF THE SECTION), IS DEPORTED UNDER SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (8 U.S.C. SEC. 1251A)) ON ANY ONE OF CERTAIN GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N). APPELLEE, AN ALIEN, IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913, AND BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN NOVEMBER 1955. IN JULY 1956 HE WAS DEPORTED PURSUANT TO SEC. 241(A)(6)(C)(I) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. THIS BEING ONE OF THE BENEFIT TERMINATION DEPORTATION GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N), APPELLEE'S BENEFITS WERE TERMINATED SOON THEREAFTER, AND NOTICE OF THE TERMINATION WAS GIVEN TO HIS WIFE, WHO HAD REMAINED IN THIS COUNTRY. (FN2) UPON HIS FAILURE TO OBTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE REVERSAL OF THE DECISION, APPELLEE COMMENCED THIS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT, PURSUANT TO SEC. 205(G) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (53 STAT. 1370, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 405(G)), TO SECURE JUDICIAL REVIEW. (FN3) ON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, THE DISTRICT COURT RULED FOR APPELLEE, HOLDING SEC. 202(N) UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT IN THAT IT DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT. 169 F. SUPP. 922. THE SECRETARY PROSECUTED AN APPEAL TO THIS COURT, AND, SUBJECT TO A JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION HEREINAFTER DISCUSSED, WE SET THE CASE DOWN FOR PLENARY HEARING. 360 U.S. 915. THE PRELIMINARY JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION IS WHETHER 28 U.S.C. SEC. 2282 IS APPLICABLE, AND THEREFORE REQUIRED THAT THE CASE BE HEARD BELOW BEFORE THREE JUDGES, RATHER THAN BY A SINGLE JUDGE, AS IT WAS. SECTION 2282 FORBIDS THE ISSUANCE, EXCEPT BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, OF ANY \"INTERLOCUTORY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION RESTRAINING THE ENFORCEMENT, OPERATION OR EXECUTION OF ANY ACT OF CONGRESS FOR REPUGNANCE TO THE CONSTITUTION ... .\" NEITHER PARTY REQUESTED A THREE-JUDGE COURT BELOW, AND IN THIS COURT BOTH PARTIES ARGUE THE INAPPLICABILITY OF SEC. 2282. IF THE PROVISION APPLIES, WE CANNOT REACH THE MERITS, BUT MUST VACATE THE JUDGMENT BELOW AND REMAND THE CASE FOR CONSIDERATION BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT. SEE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION V. THE DARLINGTON, INC., 352 U.S. 977. UNDER THE DECISIONS OF THIS COURT, THIS SEC. 205(G) ACTION COULD, AND DID, DRAW IN QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N). SEE, E.G., ANNISTON MFG. CO. V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 337, 345-346. HOWEVER, THE ACTION DID NO MORE. IT DID NOT SEEK AFFIRMATIVELY TO INTERDICT THE OPERATION OF A STATUTORY SCHEME. A JUDGMENT FOR THE APPELLEE WOULD NOT PUT THE OPERATION OF A FEDERAL STATUTE UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF AN EQUITY DECREE; INDEED, APART FROM ITS EFFECT UNDER THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS, IT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER RESULT THAN TO REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE THINK THAT WHAT WAS SAID IN GARMENT WORKERS V. DONNELLY CO., 304 U.S. 243, WHERE THIS COURT DEALT WITH AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION, IS CONTROLLING HERE: \"THE PREDECESSOR OF SEC. 2282 DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR A CASE WHERE THE VALIDITY OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS IS MERELY DRAWN IN QUESTION, ALBEIT THAT QUESTION BE DECIDED, BUT ONLY FOR A CASE WHERE THERE IS AN APPLICATION FOR AN INTERLOCUTORY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION TO RESTRAIN THE ENFORCEMENT OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS ... . HAD CONGRESS INTENDED THE PROVISION ... , FOR THREE JUDGES AND DIRECT APPEAL, TO APPLY WHENEVER A QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS BECAME INVOLVED, CONGRESS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE USED THE FAMILIAR PHRASE 'DRAWN IN QUESTION' ... .\" ID., AT 250. WE HOLD THAT JURISDICTION OVER THE ACTION WAS PROPERLY EXERCISED BY THE DISTRICT COURT, AND THEREFORE REACH THE MERITS. I. WE THINK THAT THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT SEC. 202(N) DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN \"ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT.\" 169 F. SUPP., AT 934. APPELLEE'S RIGHT TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS CANNOT PROPERLY BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN OF THAT ORDER. THE GENERAL PURPOSES UNDERLYING THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT WERE EXPOUNDED BY MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO IN HELVERING V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 619, 640-645. THE ISSUE HERE, HOWEVER, REQUIRES SOME INQUIRY INTO THE STATUTORY SCHEME BY WHICH THOSE PURPOSES ARE SOUGHT TO BE ACHIEVED. PAYMENTS UNDER THE ACT ARE BASED UPON THE WAGE EARNER'S RECORD OF EARNINGS IN EMPLOYMENT OR SELF-EMPLOYMENT COVERED BY THE ACT, AND TAKE THE FORM OF OLD-AGE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS INURING TO THE WAGE EARNER (KNOWN AS THE \"PRIMARY BENEFICIARY\"), AND OF BENEFITS, INCLUDING SURVIVOR BENEFITS, PAYABLE TO NAMED DEPENDENTS (\"SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES\") OF A WAGE EARNER. BROADLY SPEAKING, ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS DEPENDS ON SATISFYING STATUTORY CONDITIONS AS TO (1) EMPLOYMENT IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT OR SELF-EMPLOYMENT (SEE SEC. 210(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 410(A)); (2) THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF \"QUARTERS OF COVERAGE\" - I.E., THREE-MONTH PERIODS DURING WHICH NOT LESS THAN A STATED SUM WAS EARNED - THE NUMBER DEPENDING GENERALLY ON AGE (SEE SECS. 213-215, 42 U.S.C. SECS. 413-415); AND (3) ATTAINMENT OF THE RETIREMENT AGE (SEE SEC. 216(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 416(A)). SEC. 202(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(A). (FN4) ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS ONCE GAINED IS PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY LOST IF THE BENEFICIARY EARNS MORE THAN A STATED ANNUAL SUM, UNLESS HE OR SHE IS AT LEAST 72 YEARS OLD. SEC. 203(B), (E), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 403(B), (E). OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE IS THE FACT THAT ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS, AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH BENEFITS, DO NOT IN ANY TRUE SENSE DEPEND ON CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, BUT RATHER ON THE EARNINGS RECORD OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE PROGRAM IS FINANCED THROUGH A PAYROLL TAX LEVIED ON EMPLOYEES IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT, AND ON THEIR EMPLOYERS. THE TAX RATE, WHICH IS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRST $4,800 OF EMPLOYEE ANNUAL INCOME, IS SET AT A SCALE WHICH WILL INCREASE FROM YEAR TO YEAR, PRESUMABLY TO KEEP PACE WITH RISING BENEFIT COSTS. I.R.C. OF 1954, SECS. 3101, 3111, 3121(A). THE TAX PROCEEDS ARE PAID INTO THE TREASURY \"AS INTERNAL REVENUE COLLECTIONS,\" I.R.C., SEC. 3501, AND EACH YEAR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE PROCEEDS IS APPROPRIATED TO A TRUST FUND, FROM WHICH BENEFITS AND THE EXPENSES OF THE PROGRAM ARE PAID. SEC. 201, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401. IT WAS EVIDENTLY CONTEMPLATED THAT RECEIPTS WOULD GREATLY EXCEED DISBURSEMENTS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM, AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND THE INCOME RETURNED TO THE TRUST FUND. THUS, PROVISION IS MADE FOR EXPECTED INCREASING COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MAY BE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED AS A FORM OF SOCIAL INSURANCE, ENACTED PURSUANT TO CONGRESS' POWER TO \"SPEND MONEY IN AID OF THE 'GENERAL WELFARE,'\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 640, WHEREBY PERSONS GAINFULLY EMPLOYED, AND THOSE WHO EMPLOY THEM, ARE TAXED TO PERMIT THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS TO THE RETIRED AND DISABLED, AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. PLAINLY THE EXPECTATION IS THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE PRESENT PRODUCTIVE WORK FORCE WILL IN TURN BECOME BENEFICIARIES RATHER THAN SUPPORTERS OF THE PROGRAM. BUT EACH WORKER'S BENEFITS, THOUGH FLOWING FROM THE CONTRIBUTIONS HE MADE TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY WHILE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED, ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE WAS CALLED UPON TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM BY TAXATION. IT IS APPARENT THAT THE NONCONTRACTUAL INTEREST OF AN EMPLOYEE COVERED BY THE ACT CANNOT BE SOUNDLY ANALOGIZED TO THAT OF THE HOLDER OF AN ANNUITY, WHOSE RIGHT TO BENEFITS IS BOTTOMED ON HIS CONTRACTUAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS. IT IS HARDLY PROFITABLE TO ENGAGE IN CONCEPTUALIZATIONS REGARDING \"EARNED RIGHTS\" AND GRATUITIES.\" CF. LYNCH V. UNITED STATES, 292 U.S. 571, 576-577. THE \"RIGHT\" TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IS IN ONE SENSE \"EARNED,\" FOR THE ENTIRE SCHEME RESTS ON THE LEGISLATIVE JUDGMENT THAT THOSE WHO IN THEIR PRODUCTIVE YEARS WERE FUNCTIONING MEMBERS OF THE ECONOMY MAY JUSTLY CALL UPON THAT ECONOMY, IN THEIR LATER YEARS, FOR PROTECTION FROM \"THE RIGORS OF THE POOR HOUSE AS WELL AS FROM THE HAUNTING FEAR THAT SUCH A LOT AWAITS THEM WHEN JOURNEY'S END IS NEAR.\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 641. BUT THE PRACTICAL EFFECTUATION OF THAT JUDGMENT HAS OF NECESSITY CALLED FORTH A HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED STATUTORY STRUCTURE. INTEGRATED TREATMENT OF THE MANIFOLD SPECIFIC PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM DEMANDS MORE THAN A GENERALIZATION. THAT PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION INTO THE INDEFINITE FUTURE, AND ITS SPECIFIC PROVISIONS REST ON PREDICTIONS AS TO EXPECTED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH MUST INEVITABLY PROVE LESS THAN WHOLLY ACCURATE, AND ON JUDGMENTS AND PREFERENCES AS TO THE PROPER ALLOCATION OF THE NATION'S RESOURCES WHICH EVOLVING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS WILL OF NECESSITY IN SOME DEGREE MODIFY. TO ENGRAFT UPON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM A CONCEPT OF \"ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHTS\" WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER-CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS. SEE WOLLENBERG, VESTED RIGHTS IN SOCIAL-SECURITY BENEFITS, 37 ORE. L. REV. 299, 359. IT WAS DOUBTLESS OUT OF AN AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR SUCH FLEXIBILITY THAT CONGRESS INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL ACT, AND HAS SINCE RETAINED, A CLAUSE EXPRESSLY RESERVING TO IT \"THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION\" OF THE ACT. SEC. 1104, 49 STAT. 648, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 1304. THAT PROVISION MAKES EXPRESS WHAT IS IMPLICIT IN THE INSTITUTIONAL NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM. SEE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, HEARINGS BEFORE A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 83D CONG., 1ST SESS., PP. 920 921. IT WAS PURSUANT TO THAT PROVISION THAT SEC. 202(N) WAS ENACTED. WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT A PERSON COVERED BY THE ACT HAS NOT SUCH A RIGHT IN BENEFIT PAYMENTS AS WOULD MAKE EVERY DEFEASANCE OF \"ACCRUED\" INTERESTS VIOLATIVE OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. II. THIS IS NOT TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT CONGRESS MAY EXERCISE ITS POWER TO MODIFY THE STATUTORY SCHEME FREE OF ALL CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINT. THE INTEREST OF A COVERED EMPLOYEE UNDER THE ACT IS OF SUFFICIENT SUBSTANCE TO FALL WITHIN THE PROTECTION FROM ARBITRARY GOVERNMENTAL ACTION AFFORDED BY THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. IN JUDGING THE PERMISSIBILITY OF THE CUT-OFF PROVISIONS OF SEC. 202(N) FROM THIS STANDPOINT, IT IS NOT WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONGRESSIONAL JUDGMENT EXPRESSED IN THAT SECTION IS SOUND OR EQUITABLE, OR WHETHER IT COMPORTS WELL OR ILL WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE ACT. \"WHETHER WISDOM OR UNWISDOM RESIDES IN THE SCHEME OF BENEFITS SET FORTH IN TITLE II, IT IS NOT FOR US TO SAY. THE ANSWER TO SUCH INQUIRIES MUST COME FROM CONGRESS, NOT THE COURTS. OUR CONCERN HERE, AS OFTEN, IS WITH POWER, NOT WITH WISDOM.\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 644. PARTICULARLY WHEN WE DEAL WITH A WITHHOLDING OF A NONCONTRACTUAL BENEFIT UNDER A SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS, WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE CAN BE THOUGHT TO INTERPOSE A BAR ONLY IF THE STATUTE MANIFESTS A PATENTLY ARBITRARY CLASSIFICATION, UTTERLY LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION. SUCH IS NOT THE CASE HERE. THE FACT OF A BENEFICIARY'S RESIDENCE ABROAD - IN THE CASE OF A DEPORTEE, A PRESUMABLY PERMANENT RESIDENCE - CAN BE OF OBVIOUS RELEVANCE TO THE QUESTION OF ELIGIBILITY. ONE BENEFIT WHICH MAY BE THOUGHT TO ACCRUE TO THE ECONOMY FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IS THE INCREASED OVER-ALL NATIONAL PURCHASING POWER RESULTING FROM TAXATION OF PRODUCTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE ECONOMY TO PROVIDE PAYMENTS TO THE RETIRED AND DISABLED, WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DESTITUTE OR NEARLY SO, AND WHO WOULD GENERALLY SPEND A COMPARATIVELY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. THIS ADVANTAGE WOULD BE LOST AS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO ONE RESIDING ABROAD. FOR THESE PURPOSES, IT IS, OF COURSE, CONSTITUTIONALLY IRRELEVANT WHETHER THIS REASONING IN FACT UNDERLAY THE LEGISLATIVE DECISION, AS IT IS IRRELEVANT THAT THE IN LOGIC APPLY. (FN5) SEE UNITED STATES V. PETRILLO, 332 U.S. 1, 8-9; STEWARD MACHINE CO. V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 548, 584-585; CF. CARMICHAEL V. SOUTHERN COAL CO., 301 U.S. 495, 510-513. NOR, APART FROM THIS, CAN IT BE DEEMED IRRATIONAL FOR CONGRESS TO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE PUBLIC PURSE SHOULD NOT BE UTILIZED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUPPORT OF THOSE DEPORTED ON THE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN THE STATUTE. WE NEED GO NO FURTHER TO FIND SUPPORT FOR OUR CONCLUSION THAT THIS PROVISION OF THE ACT CANNOT BE CONDEMNED AS SO LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION AS TO OFFEND DUE PROCESS. III. THE REMAINING, AND MOST INSISTENTLY PRESSED, CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS REST UPON ART. I, SEC. 9, CL. 3, AND ART. III, SEC. 2, CL. 3, OF THE CONSTITUTION, AND THE SIXTH AMENDMENT. (FN6) IT IS SAID THAT THE TERMINATION OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS AMOUNTS TO PUNISHING HIM WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL, SEE WONG WING V. UNITED STATES, 163 U.S. 228; THAT THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS CONSTITUTES THE IMPOSITION OF PUNISHMENT BY LEGISLATIVE ACT, RENDERING SEC. 202(N) A BILL OF ATTAINDER\" SEE UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303; CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277; AND THAT THE PUNISHMENT EXACTED IS IMPOSED FOR PAST CONDUCT NOT UNLAWFUL WHEN ENGAGED IN, THEREBY VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION ON EX POST FACTO LAWS, SEE EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333. (FN7) ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF EACH OF THESE CONTENTIONS IS THE VALIDITY OF CHARACTERIZING AS \"PUNISHMENT\" IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS UNDER SEC. 202(N). IN DETERMINING WHETHER LEGISLATION WHICH BASES A DISQUALIFICATION ON THE HAPPENING OF A CERTAIN PAST EVENT IMPOSES A PUNISHMENT, THE COURT HAS SOUGHT TO DISCERN THE OBJECTS ON WHICH THE ENACTMENT IN QUESTION WAS FOCUSED. WHERE THE SOURCE OF LEGISLATIVE CONCERN CAN BE THOUGHT TO BE THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED, THE DISQUALIFICATION IS NOT PUNISHMENT EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BEAR HARSHLY UPON ONE AFFECTED. THE CONTRARY IS THE CASE WHERE THE STATUTE IN QUESTION IS EVIDENTLY AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED. IN THE EARLIEST CASE ON WHICH APPELLEE RELIES, A CLERGYMAN SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED A STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION BARRING FROM THAT PROFESSION - AND FROM MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS AND OFFICES - ALL WHO WOULD NOT SWEAR THAT THEY HAD NEVER MANIFESTED ANY SYMPATHY OR SUPPORT FOR THE CAUSE OF THE CONFEDERACY. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA. THE COURT THUS DESCRIBED THE AIMS OF THE CHALLENGED ENACTMENT: \"THE OATH COULD NOT ... HAVE BEEN REQUIRED AS A MEANS OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER PARTIES WERE QUALIFIED OR NOT FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE CALLINGS OR THE TRUSTS WITH WHICH THEY WERE CHARGED. IT WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO REACH THE PERSON, NOT THE CALLING. IT WAS EXACTED, NOT FROM ANY NOTION THAT THE SEVERAL ACTS DESIGNATED INDICATED UNFITNESS FOR THE CALLINGS, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE SEVERAL ACTS DESERVED PUNISHMENT ... .\" ID., AT 320. ONLY THE OTHER DAY THE GOVERNING INQUIRY WAS STATED, IN AN OPINION JOINED BY FOUR MEMBERS OF THE COURT, IN THESE TERMS: \"THE QUESTION IN EACH CASE WHERE UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES ARE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON AN INDIVIDUAL FOR PRIOR CONDUCT, IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE AIM WAS TO PUNISH THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR PAST ACTIVITY, OR WHETHER THE RESTRICTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMES ABOUT AS A RELEVANT INCIDENT TO A REGULATION OF A PRESENT SITUATION, SUCH AS THE PROPER QUALIFICATIONS FOR A PROFESSION.\" DE VEAU V. BRAISTED, 363 U.S. 144, 160 (PLURALITY OPINION). IN EX PARTE GARLAND, SUPRA, WHERE THE COURT STRUCK DOWN AN OATH - SIMILAR IN CONTENT TO THAT INVOLVED IN CUMMINGS - REQUIRED OF ATTORNEYS SEEKING TO PRACTICE BEFORE ANY FEDERAL COURT, AS ALSO IN CUMMINGS, THE FINDING OF PUNITIVE INTENT DREW HEAVILY ON THE COURT'S FIRST-HAND ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE EVENTS AND THE MOOD OF THE THEN RECENT CIVIL WAR, AND \"THE FIERCE PASSIONS WHICH THAT STRUGGLE AROUSED.\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 322. (FN8) SIMILARLY, IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, SUPRA, WHERE THE COURT INVALIDATED, AS A BILL OF ATTAINDER, A STATUTE FORBIDDING - SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS - THE FURTHER PAYMENT OF THE SALARIES OF THREE NAMED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THE DETERMINATION THAT A PUNISHMENT HAD BEEN IMPOSED RESTED IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE SPECIFIC CONGRESSIONAL HISTORY WHICH THE COURT WAS AT PAINS TO SPELL OUT IN DETAIL. SEE 328 U.S., AT 308-312. MOST RECENTLY, IN TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, WHICH HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL A STATUTE PROVIDING FOR THE EXPATRIATION OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN SENTENCED BY A COURT-MARTIAL TO DISMISSAL OR DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE FOR WARTIME DESERTION, THE MAJORITY OF THE COURT CHARACTERIZED THE STATUTE AS PUNITIVE. HOWEVER, NO SINGLE OPINION COMMANDED THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY. THE PLURALITY OPINION RESTED ITS DETERMINATION, AT LEAST IN PART, ON ITS INABILITY TO DISCERN ANY ALTERNATIVE PURPOSE WHICH THE STATUTE COULD BE THOUGHT TO SERVE. ID., AT 97. THE CONCURRING OPINION FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF PUNITIVE INTENT. ID., AT 107-109. IT IS THUS APPARENT THAT, THOUGH THE GOVERNING CRITERION MAY BE READILY STATED, EACH CASE HAS TURNED ON ITS OWN HIGHLY PARTICULARIZED CONTEXT. WHERE NO PERSUASIVE SHOWING OF A PURPOSE \"TO REACH THE PERSON, NOT THE CALLING,\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 320, HAS BEEN MADE, THE COURT HAS NOT HAMPERED LEGISLATIVE REGULATION OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN ITS SPHERE OF CONCERN, DESPITE THE OFTEN-SEVERE EFFECTS SUCH REGULATION HAS HAD ON THE PERSONS SUBJECT TO IT. (FN9) THUS, DEPORTATION HAS BEEN HELD TO BE NOT PUNISHMENT, BUT AN EXERCISE OF THE PLENARY POWER OF CONGRESS TO FIX THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ALIENS ARE TO BE PERMITTED TO ENTER AND REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY. FONG YUE TING V. UNITED STATES, 149 U.S. 698, 730; SEE GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 530-531. SIMILARLY, THE SETTING BY A STATE OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, AND THEIR MODIFICATION FROM TIME TO TIME, IS AN INCIDENT OF THE STATE'S POWER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS, AND ITS DECISION TO BAR FROM PRACTICE PERSONS WHO COMMIT OR HAVE COMMITTED A FELONY IS TAKEN AS EVIDENCING AN INTENT TO EXERCISE THAT REGULATORY POWER, AND NOT A PURPOSE TO ADD TO THE PUNISHMENT OF EX FELONS. HAWKER V. NEW YORK, 170 U.S. 189. SEE DE VEAU V. BRAISTED, SUPRA (REGULATION OF CRIME ON THE WATERFRONT THROUGH DISQUALIFICATION OF EX-FELONS FROM HOLDING UNION OFFICE). CF. HELVERING V. MITCHELL, 303 U.S. 391, 397-401, HOLDING THAT, WITH RESPECT TO DEFICIENCIES DUE TO FRAUD, A 50 PERCENT ADDITION TO THE TAX IMPOSED WAS NOT PUNISHMENT SO AS TO PREVENT, UPON PRINCIPLES OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY, ITS ASSESSMENT AGAINST ONE ACQUITTED OF TAX EVASION. TURNING, THEN, TO THE PARTICULAR STATUTORY PROVISION BEFORE US, APPELLEE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY CONTEND THAT THE LANGUAGE AND STRUCTURE OF SEC. 202(N), OR THE NATURE OF THE DEPRIVATION, REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE A PUNITIVE DESIGN. CF. WONG WING V. UNITED STATES, SUPRA (IMPRISONMENT, AT HARD LABOR UP TO ONE YEAR, OF PERSON FOUND TO BE UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY). HERE THE SANCTION IS THE MERE DENIAL OF A NONCONTRACTUAL GOVERNMENTAL BENEFIT. NO AFFIRMATIVE DISABILITY OR RESTRAINT IS IMPOSED, AND CERTAINLY NOTHING APPROACHING THE \"INFAMOUS PUNISHMENT\" OF IMPRISONMENT, AS IN WONG WING, ON WHICH GREAT RELIANCE IS MISTAKENLY PLACED. MOREOVER, FOR REASONS ALREADY GIVEN (ANTE, PP. 611-612), IT CANNOT BE SAID, AS WAS SAID OF THE STATUTE IN CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 319; SEE DENT V. WEST VIRGINIA, 129 U.S. 114, 126, THAT THE DISQUALIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEPORTEES FROM RECEIPT OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WHILE THEY ARE NOT LAWFULLY IN THIS COUNTRY BEARS NO RATIONAL CONNECTION TO THE PURPOSES OF THE LEGISLATION OF WHICH IT IS A PART, AND MUST WITHOUT MORE THEREFORE BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCING A CONGRESSIONAL DESIRE TO PUNISH. APPELLEE ARGUES, HOWEVER, THAT THE HISTORY AND SCOPE OF SEC. 202(N) PROVE THAT NO SUCH POSTULATED PURPOSE CAN BE THOUGHT TO HAVE MOTIVATED THE LEGISLATURE, AND THAT THEY PERSUASIVELY SHOW THAT A PUNITIVE PURPOSE IN FACT LAY BEHIND THE STATUTE. WE DO NOT AGREE. WE OBSERVE INITIALLY THAT ONLY THE CLEAREST PROOF COULD SUFFICE TO ESTABLISH THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF A STATUTE ON SUCH A GROUND. JUDICIAL INQUIRIES INTO CONGRESSIONAL MOTIVES ARE AT BEST A HAZARDOUS MATTER, AND WHEN THAT INQUIRY SEEKS TO GO BEHIND OBJECTIVE MANIFESTATIONS IT BECOMES A DUBIOUS AFFAIR INDEED. MOREOVER, THE PRESUMPTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY WITH WHICH THIS ENACTMENT, LIKE ANY OTHER, COMES TO US FORBIDS US LIGHTLY TO CHOOSE THAT READING OF THE STATUTE'S SETTING WHICH WILL INVALIDATE IT OVER THAT WHICH WILL SAVE IT. \"IT IS NOT ON SLIGHT IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS TO BE PRONOUNCED TO HAVE TRANSCENDED ITS POWERS, AND ITS ACTS TO BE CONSIDERED AS VOID.\" FLETCHER V. PECK, 6 CRANCH 87, 128. OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. THE PROVISION ORIGINATED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. H.R. 9366, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., SEC. 108. THE DISCUSSION IN THE HOUSE COMMITTEE REPORT, H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., PP. 5, 25, 77, DOES NOT EXPRESS THE PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE. HOWEVER, IT DOES SAY THAT THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS WOULD APPLY TO THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE \"DEPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY ... .\" ID., AT 25. IT WAS EVIDENTLY THE THOUGHT THAT SUCH WAS THE SCOPE OF THE STATUTE RESULTING FROM ITS APPLICATION TO DEPORTATION UNDER THE 14 NAMED PARAGRAPHS OF SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT. ID., AT 77. (FN10) THE SENATE COMMITTEE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE STATED REASON THAT IT HAD \"NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SUFFICIENT STUDY TO ALL THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROVISION, WHICH INVOLVES TERMINATION OF BENEFIT RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRIBUTORY PROGRAM OF OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE ... .\" S. REP. NO. 1987, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., P. 23; SEE ALSO ID., AT 76. HOWEVER, IN CONFERENCE, THE PROPOSAL WAS RESTORED IN MODIFIED FORM, (FN11) AND AS MODIFIED WAS ENACTED AS SEC. 202(N). SEE H.R. CONF. REP. NO. 2679, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., P. 18. APPELLEE ARGUES THAT THIS HISTORY DEMONSTRATES THAT CONGRESS WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE FACT OF A BENEFICIARY'S DEPORTATION - WHICH IT IS CLAIMED ALONE WOULD JUSTIFY THIS LEGISLATION AS BEING PURSUANT TO A POLICY RELEVANT TO REGULATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM - BUT THAT IT SOUGHT TO REACH CERTAIN GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION, THUS EVIDENCING A PUNITIVE INTENT. (FN12) IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN THE MEAGRE HISTORY THE UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF PUNITIVE INTENT WHICH, UNDER PRINCIPLES ALREADY DISCUSSED, IS REQUIRED BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENT OF THIS KIND MAY BE STRUCK DOWN. EVEN WERE THAT HISTORY TO BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCING CONGRESS' CONCERN WITH THE GROUNDS, RATHER THAN THE FACT, OF DEPORTATION, WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS, STANDING ALONE, WOULD SUFFICE TO ESTABLISH A PUNITIVE PURPOSE. THIS WOULD STILL BE A FAR CRY FROM THE SITUATIONS INVOLVED IN SUCH CASES AS CUMMINGS, WONG WING, AND GARLAND (SEE ANTE, P. 617), AND FROM THAT IN LOVETT, SUPRA, WHERE THE LEGISLATION WAS ON ITS FACE AIMED AT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS. THE LEGISLATIVE RECORD, HOWEVER, FALLS SHORT OF ANY PERSUASIVE SHOWING THAT CONGRESS WAS IN FACT CONCERNED ALONE WITH THE GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION. TO BE SURE CONGRESS DID NOT APPLY THE TERMINATION PROVISION TO ALL DEPORTEES. HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT NEITHER DID IT REST THE OPERATION OF THE STATUTE ON THE OCCURRENCE OF THE UNDERLYING ACT. THE FACT OF DEPORTATION ITSELF REMAINED AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR LOSS OF BENEFITS, AND EVEN IF A BENEFICIARY WERE SAVED FROM DEPORTATION ONLY THROUGH DISCRETIONARY SUSPENSION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER SEC. 244 OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (66 STAT. 214, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1254), SEC. 202(N) WOULD NOT REACH HIM. MOREOVER, THE GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION REFERRED TO IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT EMBRACE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE DEPORTED, AS IS EVIDENT FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE FOUR OMITTED GROUNDS, SUMMARIZED IN THE MARGIN. (FN13) INFERENCES DRAWN FROM THE OMISSION OF THOSE GROUNDS CANNOT ESTABLISH, TO THE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY REQUIRED, THAT CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WAS WHOLLY WITH THE ACTS LEADING TO DEPORTATION, AND NOT WITH THE FACT OF DEPORTATION. (FN14) TO HOLD OTHERWISE WOULD BE TO REST ON THE \"SLIGHT IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE\" AGAINST WHICH CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL WARNED. FLETCHER V. PECK, SUPRA, AT 128. THE SAME ANSWER MUST BE MADE TO ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM THE FAILURE OF CONGRESS TO APPLY SEC. 202(N) TO BENEFICIARIES VOLUNTARILY RESIDING ABROAD. BUT CF. SEC. 202(T), ANTE, NOTE 5. CONGRESS MAY HAVE FAILED TO CONSIDER SUCH PERSONS; OR IT MAY HAVE THOUGHT THEIR NUMBER TOO SLIGHT, OR THE PERMANENCE OF THEIR VOLUNTARY RESIDENCE ABROAD TOO UNCERTAIN, TO WARRANT APPLICATION OF THE STATUTE TO THEM, WITH ITS ATTENDANT ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION AND ENFORCEMENT. AGAIN, WE CANNOT WITH CONFIDENCE REJECT ALL THOSE ALTERNATIVES WHICH IMAGINATIVENESS CAN BRING TO MIND, SAVE THAT ONE WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE THE INVALIDATION OF THE STATUTE. REVERSED. FOOTNOTES Footnote 1- SECTION 202(N) PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: \"(N)(1) IF ANY INDIVIDUAL IS (AFTER THE DATE OF ENACTMENT OF THIS SUBSECTION) DEPORTED UNDER PARAGRAPH (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (10), (11), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), OR (18) OF SECTION 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, THEN, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE: \"(A) NO MONTHLY BENEFIT UNDER THIS SECTION OR SECTION 223 (42 U.S.C.

Footnote 11- FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE HOUSE VERSION TERMINATION OF BENEFITS OF A DEPORTEE WOULD ALSO HAVE TERMINATED BENEFITS PAID TO SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES BASED ON THE EARNING RECORDS OF THE DEPORTEE.

Footnote 12- APPELLEE ALSO RELIES ON THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THE PROPOSED SEC. 108 AND CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS, SOME OF WHICH WERE ENACTED AND SOME OF WHICH WERE NOT. THIS ARGUMENT IS TOO CONJECTURAL TO WARRANT DISCUSSION. IN ADDITION, RELIANCE IS PLACED ON A LETTER WRITTEN TO THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE BY APPELLANT'S PREDECESSOR IN OFFICE, OPPOSING THE ENACTMENT OF WHAT IS NOW SEC. 202(U) OF THE ACT, 70 STAT. 838, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(U), ON THE GROUND THAT THE SECTION WAS \"IN THE NATURE OF A PENALTY AND BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS FOREIGN TO THE OBJECTIVES\" OF THE PROGRAM. SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1955, HEARINGS BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, 84TH CONG., 2D SESS., P. 1319. THE SECRETARY WENT ON TO SAY THAT \"PRESENT LAW RECOGNIZES ONLY THREE NARROWLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS (OF WHICH SEC. 202(N) IS ONE) TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT BENEFITS ARE PAID WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ATTITUDES, OPINIONS, BEHAVIOR, OR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ... .\" IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SECRETARY DID NOT SPEAK OF SEC. 202(N) AS A PENALTY, AS HE DID OF THE PROPOSED SEC. 202(U). THE LATTER PROVISION IS CONCEDEDLY PENAL, AND APPLIES ONLY PURSUANT TO A JUDGMENT OF A COURT IN A CRIMINAL CASE. Footnote 13- THEY ARE: (1) PERSONS INSTITUTIONALIZED AT PUBLIC EXPENSE WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY BECAUSE OF \"MENTAL DISEASE, DEFECT, OR DEFICIENCY\" NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ARISEN SUBSEQUENT TO ADMISSION (SEC. 241(A)(3)); (2) PERSONS BECOMING A PUBLIC CHARGE WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY FROM CAUSES NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ARISEN SUBSEQUENT TO ADMISSION SEC. 241(A)(8)); (3) PERSONS ADMITTED AS NONIMMIGRANTS (SEE SEC. 101(A)(15), 66 STAT. 167, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1101(A)(15)) WHO FAIL TO MAINTAIN, OR COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS OF, SUCH STATUS (SEC. 241(A)(9)); (4) PERSONS KNOWINGLY AND FOR GAIN INDUCING OR AIDING, PRIOR TO OR WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY, ANY OTHER ALIEN TO ENTER OR ATTEMPT TO ENTER UNLAWFULLY (SEC. 241(A)(13)). Footnote 14- WERE WE TO ENGAGE IN SPECULATION, IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO CONJECTURE THAT CONGRESS MAY HAVE BEEN LED TO EXCLUDE THESE FOUR GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION OUT OF COMPASSIONATE OR DE MINIMIS CONSIDERATIONS. MR. JUSTICE BLACK, DISSENTING. FOR THE REASONS STATED HERE AND IN THE DISSENTS OF MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS AND MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN I AGREE WITH THE DISTRICT COURT THAT THE UNITED STATES IS DEPRIVING APPELLEE, EPHRAM NESTOR, OF HIS STATUTORY RIGHT TO OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN VIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. NESTOR CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913 AND LIVED HERE CONTINUOUSLY FOR 43 YEARS, UNTIL JULY 1956. HE WAS THEN DEPORTED FROM THIS COUNTRY FOR HAVING BEEN A COMMUNIST FROM 1933 TO 1939. AT THAT TIME MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY AS SUCH WAS NOT ILLEGAL AND WAS NOT EVEN A STATUTORY GROUND FOR DEPORTATION. FROM DECEMBER 1936 TO JANUARY 1955 NESTOR AND HIS EMPLOYERS MADE REGULAR PAYMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT, 26 U.S.C. SECS. 3101-3125. THESE FUNDS WENT TO A SPECIAL FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE TRUST FUND UNDER 49 STAT. 622, 53 STAT. 1362, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401, IN RETURN FOR WHICH NESTOR, LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHERS, EXPECTED TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS WHEN HE REACHED THE STATUTORY AGE. IN 1954, 15 YEARS AFTER NESTOR HAD LAST BEEN A COMMUNIST, AND 18 YEARS AFTER HE BEGAN TO MAKE PAYMENTS INTO THE OLD-AGE SECURITY FUND, CONGRESS PASSED A LAW PROVIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT ANY PERSON WHO HAD BEEN DEPORTED FROM THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF PAST COMMUNIST MEMBERSHIP UNDER 66 STAT. 205, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1251(A)(6)(C) SHOULD BE WHOLLY CUT OFF FROM ANY BENEFITS OF THE FUND TO WHICH HE HAD CONTRIBUTED UNDER THE LAW. 68 STAT. 1083, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(N). AFTER THE GOVERNMENT DEPORTED NESTOR IN 1956 IT NOTIFIED HIS WIFE, WHO HAD REMAINED IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT HE WAS CUT OFF AND NO FURTHER PAYMENTS WOULD BE MADE TO HIM. THIS ACTION, IT SEEMS TO ME, TAKES NESTOR'S INSURANCE WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION AND IN VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. MOREOVER, IT IMPOSES AN EX POST FACTO LAW AND BILL OF ATTAINDER BY STAMPING HIM, WITHOUT A COURT TRIAL, AS UNWORTHY TO RECEIVE THAT FOR WHICH HE HAS PAID AND WHICH THE GOVERNMENT PROMISED TO PAY HIM. THE FACT THAT THE COURT IS SUSTAINING THIS ACTION INDICATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GO THESE DAYS TO OVERLOOK VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION PERPETRATED AGAINST ANYONE WHO HAS EVER EVEN INNOCENTLY BELONGED TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY. I. IN LYNCH V. UNITED STATES, 292 U.S. 571, THIS COURT UNANIMOUSLY HELD THAT CONGRESS WAS WITHOUT POWER TO REPUDIATE AND ABROGATE IN WHOLE OR IN PART ITS PROMISES TO PAY AMOUNTS CLAIMED BY SOLDIERS UNDER THE WAR RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 1917, SECS. 400-405, 40 STAT. 409. THIS COURT HELD THAT SUCH A REPUDIATION WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT THAT \"NO PERSON SHALL BE ... DEPRIVED OF LIFE, LIBERTY, OR PROPERTY, WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW; NOR SHALL PRIVATE PROPERTY BE TAKEN FOR PUBLIC USE, WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION.\" THE COURT TODAY PUTS THE LYNCH CASE ASIDE ON THE GROUND THAT \"IT IS HARDLY PROFITABLE TO ENGAGE IN CONCEPTUALIZATIONS REGARDING 'EARNED RIGHTS' AND 'GRATUITIES.'\" FROM THIS SOUND PREMISE THE COURT GOES ON TO SAY THAT WHILE \"THE 'RIGHT' TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IS IN ONE SENSE 'EARNED,'\" YET THE GOVERNMENT'S INSURANCE SCHEME NOW BEFORE US RESTS NOT ON THE IDEA OF THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND EARNING SOMETHING, BUT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT THEY MAY \"JUSTLY CALL\" UPON THE GOVERNMENT \"IN THEIR LATER YEARS, FOR PROTECTION FROM 'THE RIGORS OF THE POOR HOUSE AS WELL AS FROM THE HAUNTING FEAR THAT SUCH A LOT AWAITS THEM WHEN JOURNEY'S END IS NEAR.'\" THESE ARE NICE WORDS BUT THEY CANNOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT THEY SIMPLY TELL THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS INSURANCE FUND THAT DESPITE THEIR OWN AND THEIR EMPLOYERS' PAYMENTS THE GOVERNMENT, IN PAYING THE BENEFICIARIES OUT OF THE FUND, IS MERELY GIVING THEM SOMETHING FOR NOTHING AND CAN STOP DOING SO WHEN IT PLEASES. THIS, IN MY JUDGMENT, REVEALS A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE PURPOSE CONGRESS AND THE COUNTRY HAD IN PASSING THAT LAW. IT WAS THEN GENERALLY AGREED, AS IT IS TODAY, THAT IT IS NOT DESIRABLE THAT AGED PEOPLE THINK OF THE GOVERNMENT AS GIVING THEM SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. AN EXCELLENT STATEMENT OF THIS VIEW, QUOTED BY MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS IN ANOTHER CONNECTION, WAS MADE BY SENATOR GEORGE, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT WAS PASSED, AND ONE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PHILOSOPHY THAT BROUGHT IT ABOUT: \"IT COMPORTS BETTER THAN ANY SUBSTITUTE WE HAVE DISCOVERED WITH THE AMERICAN CONCEPT THAT FREE MEN WANT TO EARN THEIR SECURITY AND NOT ASK FOR DOLES - THAT WHAT IS DUE AS A MATTER OF EARNED RIGHT IS FAR BETTER THAN A GRATUITY ... \"SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT A HANDOUT; IT IS NOT CHARITY; IT IS NOT RELIEF. IT IS AN EARNED RIGHT BASED UPON THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AS AN EARNED RIGHT, THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE HIS BENEFIT IN DIGNITY AND SELF-RESPECT.\" 102 CONG. REC. 15110. THE PEOPLE COVERED BY THIS ACT ARE NOW ABLE TO RELY WITH COMPLETE ASSURANCE ON THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO CONTRIBUTE REGULARLY TO THIS FUND WHENEVER EACH CONTRIBUTION FALLS DUE. I BELIEVE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO RELY WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE ON GETTING THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE PAID FOR AND HAVE BEEN PROMISED, WHEN THEIR DISABILITY OR AGE MAKES THEIR INSURANCE PAYABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LAW. THE COURT DID NOT PERMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO BREAK ITS PLIGHTED FAITH WITH THE SOLDIERS IN THE LYNCH CASE; IT SAID THE CONSTITUTION FORBADE SUCH GOVERNMENTAL CONDUCT. I WOULD SAY PRECISELY THE SAME THING HERE. THE COURT CONSOLES THOSE WHOSE INSURANCE IS TAKEN AWAY TODAY, AND OTHERS WHO MAY SUFFER THE SAME FATE IN THE FUTURE, BY SAYING THAT A DECISION REQUIRING THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM TO KEEP FAITH \"WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS.\" PEOPLE WHO PAY PREMIUMS FOR INSURANCE USUALLY THINK THEY ARE PAYING FOR INSURANCE, NOT FOR \"FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS.\" I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ANY PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY IN AMERICA WOULD BE PERMITTED TO REPUDIATE ITS MATURED CONTRACTS WITH ITS POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE REGULARLY PAID ALL THEIR PREMIUMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE GOOD FAITH OF THE COMPANY. IT IS TRUE, AS THE COURT SAYS, THAT THE ORIGINAL ACT CONTAINED A CLAUSE, STILL IN FORCE, THAT EXPRESSLY RESERVES TO CONGRESS \"THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION\" OF THE ACT. SEC. 1104, 49 STAT. 648, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 1304. CONGRESS, OF COURSE PROPERLY RETAINED THAT POWER. IT COULD REPEAL THE ACT SO AS TO CEASE TO OPERATE ITS OLD-AGE INSURANCE ACTIVITIES FOR THE FUTURE. THIS MEANS THAT IT COULD STOP COVERING NEW PEOPLE, AND EVEN STOP INCREASING ITS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS OLD CONTRIBUTORS. BUT THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM DISAPPOINTING THE JUST EXPECTATIONS OF THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS COMPELLED THEM AND THEIR EMPLOYERS TO PAY ITS TREASURY. THERE IS NOTHING \"CONCEPTUALISTIC\" ABOUT SAYING, AS THIS COURT DID IN LYNCH, THAT SUCH A TAKING AS THIS THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS. II. IN PART II OF ITS OPINION, THE COURT THROWS OUT A LINE OF HOPE BY ITS SUGGESTION THAT IF CONGRESS IN THE FUTURE CUTS OFF SOME OTHER GROUP FROM THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE BOUGHT FROM THE GOVERNMENT, THIS COURT MIGHT POSSIBLY HOLD THAT THE FUTURE HYPOTHETICAL ACT VIOLATES THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. IN DOING SO IT READS DUE PROCESS AS AFFORDING ONLY MINIMAL PROTECTION, AND UNDER THIS READING IT WILL PROTECT ALL FUTURE GROUPS FROM DESTRUCTION OF THEIR RIGHTS ONLY IF CONGRESS \"MANIFESTS A PATENTLY ARBITRARY CLASSIFICATION, UTTERLY LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION.\" THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE SO DEFINED PROVIDES LITTLE PROTECTION INDEED COMPARED WITH THE SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS OF THE CONSTITUTION SUCH AS ITS PROHIBITIONS AGAINST TAKING PRIVATE PROPERTY FOR A PUBLIC USE WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION, PASSING EX POST FACTO LAWS, AND IMPOSING BILLS OF ATTAINDER. I CANNOT AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE IS PROPERLY INTERPRETED WHEN IT IS USED TO SUBORDINATE AND DILUTE THE SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND WHEN \"DUE PROCESS\" ITSELF BECOMES SO WHOLLY DEPENDENT UPON THIS COURT'S IDEA OF WHAT IS \"ARBITRARY\" AND \"RATIONAL.\" SEE LEVINE V. UNITED STATES, 362 U.S. 610, 620 (DISSENTING OPINION); ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA, 332 U.S. 46, 89-92 (DISSENTING OPINION); ROCHIN V. CALIFORNIA, 342 U.S. 165, 174 (CONCURRING OPINION). ONE REASON FOR MY BELIEF IN THIS RESPECT IS THAT I AGREE WITH WHAT IS SAID IN THE COURT'S QUOTATION FROM HELVERING V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 619, 644: \"WHETHER WISDOM OR UNWISDOM RESIDES IN THE SCHEME OF BENEFITS SET FORTH IN TITLE II, IT IS NOT FOR US TO SAY. THE ANSWER TO SUCH INQUIRIES MUST COME FROM CONGRESS, NOT THE COURTS. OUR CONCERN HERE, AS OFTEN, IS WITH POWER, NOT WITH WISDOM.\" AND YET THE COURT'S ASSUMPTION OF ITS POWER TO HOLD ACTS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THE COURT THINKS THEY ARE ARBITRARY AND IRRATIONAL CAN BE NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN A JUDICIAL FORAY INTO THE FIELD OF GOVERNMENTAL POLICY. BY THE USE OF THIS DUE PROCESS FORMULA THE COURT DOES NOT, AS ITS PROPONENTS FREQUENTLY PROCLAIM, ABSTAIN FROM INTERFERING WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL POLICY. IT ACTIVELY ENTERS THAT FIELD WITH NO STANDARDS EXCEPT ITS OWN CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT IS \"ARBITRARY\" AND WHAT IS \"RATIONAL.\" AND THIS ELASTIC FORMULA GIVES THE COURT A FURTHER POWER, THAT OF HOLDING LEGISLATIVE ACTS CONSTITUTIONAL ON THE GROUND THAT THEY ARE NEITHER ARBITRARY NOR IRRATIONAL, EVEN THOUGH THE ACTS VIOLATE SPECIFIC BILL OF RIGHTS SAFEGUARDS. SEE MY DISSENT IN ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA, SUPRA. WHETHER THIS ACT HAD \"RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION\" WAS, IN MY JUDGMENT, FOR CONGRESS; WHETHER IT VIOLATES THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL IS FOR US TO DETERMINE, UNLESS WE ARE BY CIRCUMLOCUTION TO ABDICATE THE POWER THAT THIS COURT HAS BEEN HELD TO HAVE EVER SINCE MARBURY V. MADISON, 1 CRANCH 137. III. THE COURT IN PART III OF ITS OPINION HOLDS THAT THE 1954 ACT IS NOT AN EX POST FACTO LAW OR BILL OR ATTAINDER EVEN THOUGH IT CREATES A CLASS OF DEPORTEES WHO CANNOT COLLECT THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE ONCE COMMUNISTS AT A TIME WHEN SIMPLY BEING A COMMUNIST WAS NOT ILLEGAL. THE COURT ALSO PUTS GREAT EMPHASIS ON ITS BELIEF THAT THE ACT HERE IS NOT PUNISHMENT. ALTHOUGH NOT BELIEVING THAT THE PARTICULAR LABEL \"PUNISHMENT\" IS OF DECISIVE IMPORTANCE, I THINK THE ACT DOES IMPOSE PUNISHMENT EVEN IN A CLASSIC SENSE. THE BASIC REASON FOR NESTOR'S LOSS OF HIS INSURANCE PAYMENTS IS THAT HE WAS ONCE A COMMUNIST. THIS MAN, NOW 69 YEARS OLD, HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHERE HE HAS LIVED FOR 43 YEARS TO A LAND WHERE HE IS PRACTICALLY A STRANGER, UNDER AN ACT AUTHORIZING HIS DEPORTATION MANY YEARS AFTER HIS COMMUNIST MEMBERSHIP. CF. GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 532, 533 (DISSENTING OPINIONS). NOW A SIMILAR EX POST FACTO LAW DEPRIVES HIM OF HIS INSURANCE, WHICH, WHILE PETTY AND INSIGNIFICANT IN AMOUNT TO THIS GREAT GOVERNMENT, MAY WELL BE THIS EXILE'S DAILY BREAD, FOR THE SAME REASON AND IN ACCORD WITH THE GENERAL FASHION OF THE DAY - THAT IS, TO PUNISH IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE ANYONE WHO EVER MADE THE MISTAKE OF BEING A COMMUNIST IN THIS COUNTRY OR WHO IS SUPPOSED EVER TO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ANYONE WHO MADE THAT MISTAKE. SEE, E.G., BARENBLATT V. UNITED STATES, 360 U.S. 109, AND UPHAUS V. WYMAN, 360 U.S. 72. IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303, 315-316, WE SAID: \" ... LEGISLATIVE ACTS, NO MATTER WHAT THEIR FORM, THAT APPLY EITHER TO NAMED INDIVIDUALS OR TO EASILY ASCERTAINABLE MEMBERS OF A GROUP IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INFLICT PUNISHMENT ON THEM WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL ARE BILLS OF ATTAINDER PROHIBITED BY THE CONSTITUTION.\" FAITHFUL OBSERVANCE OF OUR HOLDINGS IN THAT CASE, IN EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333, AND IN CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277, WOULD, IN MY JUDGMENT, REQUIRE US TO HOLD THAT THE 1954 ACT IS A BILL OF ATTAINDER. IT IS A CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENT AIMED AT AN EASILY ASCERTAINABLE GROUP; IT IS CERTAINLY PUNISHMENT IN ANY NORMAL SENSE OF THE WORD TO TAKE AWAY FROM ANY PERSON THE BENEFITS OF AN INSURANCE SYSTEM INTO WHICH HE AND HIS EMPLOYER HAVE PAID THEIR MONEYS FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES; AND IT DOES ALL THIS WITHOUT A TRIAL ACCORDING TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW. IT IS TRUE THAT THE LOVETT, CUMMINGS AND GARLAND COURT OPINIONS WERE NOT UNANIMOUS, BUT THEY NONETHELESS REPRESENT POSITIVE PRECEDENTS ON HIGHLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY WHICH SHOULD NOT BE EXPLAINED AWAY WITH COBWEBBERY REFINEMENTS. IF THE COURT IS GOING TO OVERRULE THESE CASES IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AND ADOPT THE VIEWS OF PREVIOUS DISSENTERS, I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE DONE CLEARLY AND FORTHRIGHTLY. A BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITY OF THIS ACT, IN MY JUDGMENT, IS THAT IT IS A PART OF A PATTERN OF LAWS ALL OF WHICH VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT OUT OF FEAR THAT THIS COUNTRY IS IN GRAVE DANGER IF IT LETS A HANDFUL OF COMMUNIST FANATICS OR SOME OTHER EXTREMIST GROUP MAKE THEIR ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSS THEIR IDEAS. THIS FEAR, I THINK, IS BASELESS. IT REFLECTS A LACK OF FAITH IN THE STURDY PATRIOTISM OF OUR PEOPLE AND DOES NOT GIVE TO THE WORLD A TRUE PICTURE OF OUR ABIDING STRENGTH. IT IS AN UNWORTHY FEAR IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS A BILL OF RIGHTS CONTAINING PROVISONS FOR FAIR TRIALS, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, PRESS AND RELIGION, AND OTHER SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS DESIGNED TO KEEP MEN FREE. I REPEAT ONCE MORE THAT I THINK THIS NATION'S GREATEST SECURITY LIES, NOT IN TRUSTING TO A MOMENTARY MAJORITY OF THIS COURT'S VIEW AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OF WHAT IS \"PATENTLY ARBITRARY,\" BUT IN WHOLEHEARTED DEVOTION TO AND OBSERVANCE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS. SEE WIEMAN V. UPDEGRAFF, 344 U.S. 183, 192 (CONCURRING OPINION). I WOULD AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT WHICH HELD THAT NESTOR IS CONSTITUTIONALLY ENTITLED TO COLLECT HIS INSURANCE. MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING. APPELLEE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913 AND WAS EMPLOYED, SO AS TO BE COVERED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, FROM DECEMBER 1936 TO JANUARY 1955 - A PERIOD OF 19 YEARS. HE BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR RETIREMENT AND FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IN NOVEMBER 1955 AND WAS AWARDED $55.60 PER MONTH. IN JULY 1956 HE WAS DEPORTED FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. PURSUANT TO A LAW, ENACTED SEPTEMBER 1, 1954, HE WAS THEREUPON DENIED PAYMENT OF FURTHER SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. THIS 1954 LAW SEEMS TO ME TO BE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A BILL OF ATTAINDER, WHICH ART. I, SEC. 9 OF THE CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS CONGRESS FROM ENACTING. A BILL OF ATTAINDER IS A LEGISLATIVE ACT WHICH INFLICTS PUNISHMENT WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277, 323. IN THE OLD DAYS PUNISHMENT WAS METED OUT TO A CREDITOR OR RIVAL OR ENEMY BY SENDING HIM TO THE GALLOWS. BUT AS RECENTLY STATED BY IRVING BRANT: (FN1) \" ... BY SMITING A MAN DAY AFTER DAY WITH SLANDEROUS WORDS, BY TAKING AWAY HIS OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A LIVING, YOU CAN DRAIN THE BLOOD FROM HIS VEINS WITHOUT EVEN SCRATCHING HIS SKIN. \"TODAY'S BILL OF ATTAINDER IS BROADER THAN THE CLASSIC FORM, AND NOT SO TALL AND SHARP. THERE IS MENTAL IN PLACE OF PHYSICAL TORTURE, AND CONFISCATION OF TOMMORROW'S BREAD AND BUTTER INSTEAD OF YESTERDAY'S LAND AND GOLD. WHAT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR IS THAT HATE, FEAR AND PREJUDICE PLAY THE SAME ROLE TODAY, IN THE DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN AMERICA THAT THEY DID IN ENGLAND WHEN A FRENZIED MOB OF LORDS, JUDGES, BISHOPS AND SHOEMAKERS TURNED THE TITUS OATES BLACKLIST INTO A HANGMAN'S RECORD. HATE, JEALOUSY AND SPITE CONTINUE TO FILL THE LEGISLATIVE ATTAINDER LISTS JUST AS THEY DID IN THE IRISH PARLIAMENT OF EX-KING JAMES.\" BILLS OF ATTAINDER, WHEN THEY IMPOSED PUNISHMENT LESS THAN DEATH, WERE BILLS OF PAINS AND PENALTIES AND EQUALLY BEYOND THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF CONGRESS. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 323. PUNISHMENT IN THE SENSE OF A BILL OF ATTAINDER INCLUDES THE \"DEPRIVATION OR SUSPENSION OF POLITICAL OR CIVIL RIGHTS.\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 322. IN THAT CASE IT WAS BARRING A PRIEST FROM PRACTICING HIS PROFESSION. IN EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333, IT WAS EXCLUDING A MAN FROM PRACTICING LAW IN THE FEDERAL COURTS. IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303, IT WAS CUTTING OFF EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION AND BARRING THEM PERMANENTLY FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE. CUTTING OFF A PERSON'S LIVELIHOOD BY DENYING HIM ACCRUED SOCIAL BENEFITS - PART OF HIS PROPERTY INTERESTS - IS NO LESS A PUNISHMENT. HERE, AS IN THE OTHER CASES CITED, THE PENALTY EXACTED HAS ONE OF THE CLASSIC PURPOSES OF PUNISHMENT (FN2) - \"TO REPRIMAND THE WRONGDOER TO DETER OTHERS.\" TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, 96. SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS ARE NOT GRATUITIES. THEY ARE PRODUCTS OF A CONTRIBUTORY SYSTEM, THE FUNDS BEING RAISED BY PAYMENT FROM EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE, OR IN CASE OF SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS, BY THE INDIVIDUAL ALONE. SEE SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD V. NIEROTKO, 327 U.S. 358, 364. THE FUNDS ARE PLACED IN THE FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE TRUST FUND, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401(A); AND ONLY THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND ARE ENTITLED TO ITS BENEFITS, THE AMOUNT OF BENEFITS BEING RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS MADE. SEE STARK, SOCIAL SECURITY: ITS IMPORTANCE TO LAWYERS, 43 A.B.A.J. 319, 321 (1957). AS THE LATE SENATOR GEORGE, LONG CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE AND ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, SAID: \"THERE HAS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE YEARS A FEELING BOTH IN AND OUT OF CONGRESS THAT THE CONTRIBUTORY SOCIAL INSURANCE PRINCIPLE FITS OUR TIMES - THAT IT SERVES A VITAL NEED THAT CANNOT BE AS WELL SERVED OTHERWISE. IT COMPORTS BETTER THAN ANY SUBSTITUTE WE HAVE DISCOVERED WITH THE AMERICAN CONCEPT THAT FREE MEN WANT TO EARN THEIR SECURITY AND NOT ASK FOR DOLES - THAT WHAT IS DUE AS A MATTER OF EARNED RIGHT IS FAR BETTER THAN A GRATUITY ... \"SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT A HANDOUT; IT IS NOT CHARITY; IT IS NOT RELIEF. IT IS AN EARNED RIGHT BASED UPON THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AS AN EARNED RIGHT, THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE HIS BENEFIT IN DIGNITY AND SELF-RESPECT.\" 102 CONG. REC. 15110. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS HAVE RIGHTLY COME TO BE REGARDED AS BASIC FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGAINST THE HAZARDS OF OLD AGE AND DISABILITY. AS STATED IN A RECENT HOUSE REPORT: \"THE OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE SYSTEM IS THE BASIC PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR AMERICA'S FAMILIES AGAINST THE LOSS OF EARNED INCOME UPON THE RETIREMENT OR DEATH OF THE FAMILY PROVIDER. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES BENEFITS RELATED TO EARNED INCOME AND SUCH BENEFITS ARE PAID FOR BY THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO PERSONS WORKING IN COVERED OCCUPATIONS.\" H.R. REP. NO. 1189, 84TH CONG., 1ST SESS. 2. CONGRESS COULD PROVIDE THAT ONLY PEOPLE RESIDENT HERE COULD GET SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. YET BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE REJECTED ANY RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS. SEE H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 24-25; S. REP. NO. 1987, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 23. CONGRESS CONCEDEDLY MIGHT AMEND THE PROGRAM TO MEET NEW CONDITIONS. BUT MAY IT TAKE AWAY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS FROM ONE PERSON OR FROM A GROUP OF PERSONS FOR VINDICTIVE REASONS? COULD CONGRESS ON DEPORTING AN ALIEN FOR HAVING BEEN A COMMUNIST CONFISCATE HIS HOME, APPROPRIATE HIS SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, AND THUS SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY PENNILESS? I THINK NOT. ANY SUCH ACT WOULD BE A BILL OF ATTAINDER. THE DIFFERENCE, AS I SEE IT, BETWEEN THAT CASE AND THIS IS ONE MERELY OF DEGREE. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, MADE UP IN PART OF THIS ALIEN'S OWN EARNINGS, ARE TAKEN FROM HIM BECAUSE HE ONCE WAS A COMMUNIST. THE VIEW THAT SEC. 202(N), WITH WHICH WE NOW DEAL, IMPOSES A PENALTY WAS TAKEN BY SECRETARY FOLSOM, APPELLANT'S PREDECESSOR, WHEN OPPOSING ENLARGEMENT OF THE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE TO BE DENIED BENEFITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY, E.G., THOSE CONVICTED OF TREASON AND SEDITION. HE SAID: \"BECAUSE THE DEPRIVATION OF BENEFITS AS PROVIDED IN THE AMENDMENT IS IN THE NATURE OF A PENALTY AND BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS FOREIGN TO THE OBJECTIVES AND PROVISIONS OF THE OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE PROGRAM, THE AMENDMENT MAY WELL SERVE AS A PRECEDENT FOR EXTENSION OF SIMILAR PROVISIONS TO OTHER PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND TO OTHER CRIMES WHICH, WHILE PERHAPS DIFFERENT IN DEGREE, ARE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH IN PRINCIPLE. \"THE PRESENT LAW RECOGNIZES ONLY THREE NARROWLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS (FN3) TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT BENEFITS ARE PAID WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ATTITUDES, OPINIONS, BEHAVIOR, OR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ... .\" HEARINGS, SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1955, 84TH CONG., 2D SESS. 1319.

Footnote 2- THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE IDEA OF PUNISHMENT BEHIND THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL OF ATTAINDER WAS STATED AS FOLLOWS BY IRVING BRANT, OP. CIT., SUPRA, NOTE 1, 9-10: \"IN 1794 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH EXISTS TODAY. SUPPORTERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAD ORGANIZED THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES - BLATANTLY ADOPTING THAT SUBVERSIVE TITLE. THEN THE WHISKY REBELLION EXPLODED IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES WERE BLAMED. A MOTION CENSURING THE SOCIETIES WAS INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. \"THERE, IN 1794, YOU HAD THE BASIC DIVISION IN AMERICAN THOUGHT - ON ONE SIDE THE DOCTRINE OF POLITICAL LIBERTY FOR EVERYBODY, WITH COLLECTIVE SECURITY RESTING ON THE CAPACITY OF THE PEOPLE FOR SELF GOVERNMENT; ON THE OTHER SIDE THE DOCTRINE THAT THE PEOPLE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED AND POLITICAL LIBERTY MUST BE RESTRAINED. \"JAMES MADISON CHALLENGED THIS LATTER DOCTRINE. THE INVESTIGATIVE POWER OF CONGRESS OVER PERSONS, HE CONTENDED, WAS LIMITED TO INQUIRY INTO THE CONDUCT OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 'OPINIONS,' HE SAID, 'ARE NOT THE SUBJECTS OF LEGISLATION.' START CRITICIZING PEOPLE FOR ABUSE OF THEIR RESERVED RIGHTS, AND THE CENSURE MIGHT EXTEND TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS. WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT ON THE PEOPLE THUS CONDEMNED? SAID MADISON: \"'IT IS IN VAIN TO SAY THAT THIS INDISCRIMINATE CENSURE IS NO PUNISHMENT ... . IS NOT THIS PROPOSITION, IF VOTED, A BILL OF ATTAINDER?' \"MADISON WON HIS FIGHT, NOT BECAUSE HE CALLED THE RESOLUTION A BILL OF ATTAINDER, BUT BECAUSE IT ATTAINTED TOO MANY MEN WHO WERE GOING TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION. THE DEFINITION, HOWEVER, WAS THERE - A BILL OF ATTAINDER - AND THE DEFINITION WAS GIVEN BY THE FOREMOST AMERICAN AUTHORITY ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND ORDER UNDERLYING OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.\" Footnote 3- THE THREE EXCEPTIONS REFERRED TO WERE (1) SEC. 202(N); (2) ACT OF SEPTEMBER 1, 1954, 68 STAT. 1142, 5 U.S.C.

Footnote 4- BRANT, OP. CIT., SUPRA, NOTE 1, STATES AT P. 9: \"WHAT WERE THE FRAMERS AIMING AT WHEN THEY FORBADE BILLS OF ATTAINDER? THEY WERE, OF COURSE, GUARDING AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS PASSIONS THAT DISGRACED CHRISTIANITY IN EUROPE. BUT AMERICAN BILLS OF ATTAINDER, JUST BEFORE 1787, WERE TYPICALLY USED BY REVOLUTIONARY ASSEMBLIES TO RID THE STATES OF BRITISH LOYALISTS. BY A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE, IT WAS USUALLY THE TORY WITH A GOOD FARM WHO WAS SENT INTO EXILE, AND ALL TOO OFTEN IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO WANTED THAT FARM WHO INDUCED THE LEGISLATURE TO ATTAINT HIM.

EDMUND RANDOLPH TAUNTED HIM WITH HIS SPONSORSHIP OF THE PHILLIPS BILL OF ATTAINDER. HENRY THEN MADE THE BLUNDER OF DEFENDING IT. THE BILL WAS WARRANTED, HE SAID, BECAUSE PHILLIPS WAS NO SOCRATES.

IT WAS NOT UNTIL A YEAR LATER THAT PAST MEMBERSHIP WAS MADE A SPECIFIC GROUND FOR DEPORTATION. (FN1) THIS PAST MEMBERSHIP HAS COST NESTOR DEAR. IT BROUGHT HIM EXPULSION FROM THE COUNTRY AFTER 43 YEARS' RESIDENCE - MOST OF HIS LIFE. NOW MORE IS EXACTED FROM HIM, FOR AFTER HE HAD BEGUN TO RECEIVE BENEFITS IN 1955 - HAVING WORKED IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT THE REQUIRED TIME AND REACHED AGE 65 - AND MIGHT ANTICIPATE RECEIVING THEM THE REST OF HIS LIFE, THE BENEFITS WERE STOPPED PURSUANT TO SEC. 202(N) OF THE AMENDED SOCIAL SECURITY ACT. (FN2) HIS PREDICAMENT IS VERY REAL - AN AGING MAN DEPRIVED OF THE MEANS WITH WHICH TO LIVE AFTER BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY AND EXILED TO LIVE AMONG STRANGERS IN A LAND HE QUIT 47 YEARS AGO. THE COMMON SENSE OF IT IS THAT HE HAS BEEN PUNISHED SEVERELY FOR HIS PAST CONDUCT. EVEN THE 1950 STATUTE DEPORTING ALIENS FOR PAST MEMBERSHIP RAISED SERIOUS QUESTIONS IN THIS COURT WHETHER THE PROHIBITION AGAINST EX POST FACTO LAWS WAS VIOLATED. IN GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 531, WE SAID \"SINCE THE INTRINSIC CONSEQUENCES OF DEPORTATION ARE SO CLOSE TO PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME, IT MIGHT FAIRLY BE SAID ALSO THAT THE EX POST FACTO CLAUSE, EVEN THOUGH APPLICABLE ONLY TO PUNITIVE LEGISLATION, SHOULD BE APPLIED TO DEPORTATION.\" HOWEVER, PRECEDENTS WHICH TREAT DEPORTATION NOT AS PUNISHMENT, BUT AS A PERMISSIBLE EXERCISE OF CONGRESSIONAL POWER TO ENACT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ALIENS MAY COME TO AND REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY, GOVERNED THE DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE. HOWEVER, THE COURT CANNOT REST A DECISION THAT SEC. 202(N) DOES NOT IMPOSE PUNISHMENT ON CONGRESS' POWER TO REGULATE IMMIGRATION. IT ESCAPES THE COMMON-SENSE CONCLUSION THAT CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED PUNISHMENT BY FINDING THE REQUISITE RATIONAL NEXUS TO A GRANTED POWER IN THE SUPPOSED FURTHERANCE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM \"ENACTED PURSUANT TO CONGRESS' POWER TO 'SPEND MONEY IN AID OF THE \"GENERAL WELFARE.\"'\" I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE COURT TO DENY THAT BUT FOR THAT CONNECTION, SEC. 202(N) WOULD IMPOSE PUNISHMENT AND NOT ONLY OFFEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION ON EX POST FACTO LAWS BUT ALSO VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES AGAINST IMPOSITION OF PUNISHMENT WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL. THE COURT'S TEST OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N) IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE CONCERN UNDERLYING THE STATUTE WAS TO REGULATE \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED\" OR WHETHER THE STATUTE \"IS EVIDENTLY AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" IT REJECTS THE INFERENCE THAT THE STATUTE IS \"AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED\" BY RELYING UPON THE PRESUMPTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY. THIS PRESUMPTION MIGHT BE A BASIS FOR SUSTAINING THE STATUTE IF IN FACT THERE WERE TWO OPPOSING INFERENCES WHICH COULD REASONABLY BE DRAWN FROM THE LEGISLATION, ONE THAT IT IMPOSES PUNISHMENT AND THE OTHER THAT IT IS PURPOSED TO FURTHER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. THE COURT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT LIMIT THE PRESUMPTION TO THAT USE. RATHER THE PRESUMPTION BECOMES A COMPLETE SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY SUPPORTABLE FINDING OF A RATIONAL CONNECTION OF SEC. 202(N) WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. FOR ME IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO STATE THE TEST AND HOLD THAT THE PRESUMPTION ALONE SATISFIES IT. I FIND IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE ACT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THERE IS GROUND FOR THE INFERENCE OF A CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. ONLY AFTER THIS INQUIRY WOULD I CONSIDER THE APPLICATION OF THE PRESUMPTION. THE COURT SEEMS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STATUTE BEARS HARSHLY UPON THE INDIVIDUAL DISQUALIFIED, BUT STATES THAT THIS IS PERMISSIBLE WHEN A STATUTE IS ENACTED AS A REGULATION OF THE ACTIVITY. BUT SURELY THE HARSHNESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES IS ITSELF A RELEVANT CONSIDERATION TO THE INQUIRY INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL PURPOSE. (FN3) CF. TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, 110 (CONCURRING OPINION). IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE STATUTE ITSELF SHOWS THAT THE SOLE LEGISLATIVE CONCERN WAS WITH \"THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" CONGRESS DID NOT DISQUALIFY FOR BENEFITS ALL BENEFICIARIES RESIDING ABROAD OR EVEN ALL DEPENDENTS RESIDING ABROAD WHO ARE ALIENS. IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE I MIGHT AGREE THAT CONGRESS' CONCERN WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS\" AND NOT WITH THE \"PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" THE SCALES WOULD THEN BE TIPPED TOWARD THE CONCLUSION THAT CONGRESS DESIRED TO LIMIT BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WOULD BE AIDED BY EXPENDITURE OF BENEFITS HERE. INDEED A PROPOSAL ALONG THOSE LINES WAS SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS IN 1954, AT THE SAME TIME SEC. 202(N) WAS PROPOSED, (FN4) AND IT WAS REJECTED. (FN5) PERHAPS, THE COURT'S CONCLUSION THAT REGULATION OF \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS\" WAS THE CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WOULD BE A FAIR APPRAISAL OF THE STATUTE IF CONGRESS HAD TERMINATED THE BENEFITS OF ALL ALIEN BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE DEPORTED. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT CONGRESS DID. THE 18 GROUNDS FOR WHICH ALIENS MAY BE DEPORTED. (FN6) H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 25, 77, CITED BY THE COURT, DESCRIBES SEC. 202(N) AS INCLUDING PERSONS WHO WERE DEPORTED \"BECAUSE OF UNLAWFUL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY.\" THE ACTS AS NARCOTIC ADDICTION OR PROSTITUTION. THE COMMON ELEMENT OF THE 14 GROUNDS IS THAT THE ALIEN HAS BEEN GUILTY OF SOME BLAMEWORTHY CONDUCT. IN OTHER WORDS CONGRESS WORKED ITS WILL ONLY ON ALIENS DEPORTED FOR CONDUCT DISPLEASING TO THE LAWMAKERS. THIS IS PLAINLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE REMAINING FOUR GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION, THOSE WHICH DO NOT RESULT IN THE CANCELLATION OF BENEFITS. (FN7) TWO OF THOSE FOUR GROUNDS COVER PERSONS WHO BECOME PUBLIC CHARGES WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY FOR REASONS WHICH PREDATED THE ENTRY. A THIRD GROUND COVERS THE ALIEN WHO FAILS TO MAINTAIN HIS NONIMMIGRANT STATUS. THE FOURTH GROUND REACHES THE ALIEN WHO, PRIOR TO OR WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY, AIDS OTHER ALIENS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. THOSE WHO ARE DEPORTED FOR BECOMING PUBLIC CHARGES CLEARLY HAVE NOT, BY MODERN STANDARDS, ENGAGED IN CONDUCT WORTHY OF CENSURE. THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT THE REASON FOR THEIR EXCLUSION FROM SEC. 202(N) WAS AN UNARTICULATED FEELING OF CONGRESS THAT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO THE \"OTHER COUNTRY TO DEPORT SUCH DESTITUTE PERSONS WITHOUT LETTING THEM RETAIN THEIR MODICUM OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS\" APPEARS AT BEST FANCIFUL, ESPECIALLY SINCE, BY HYPOTHESIS, THEY ARE DEPORTABLE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO THEIR BECOMING PUBLIC CHARGES EXISTED PRIOR TO ENTRY. THE EXCLUSION FROM THE OPERATION OF SEC. 202(N) OF ALIENS DEPORTED FOR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN NONIMMIGRANT STATUS RATIONALLY CAN BE EXPLAINED, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE STATUTE, ONLY AS EVIDENCING THAT CONGRESS CONSIDERED THAT CONDUCT LESS BLAMEWORTHY. CERTAINLY THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT CONGRESS MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT SUCH PERSONS WOULD WORK SUFFICIENT TIME IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS CANNOT BE THE REASON FOR THIS EXCLUSION. FOR FREQUENTLY THE VERY ACT WHICH EVENTUALLY RESULTS IN THE DEPORTATION OF PERSONS ON THAT GROUND IS THE SECURING OF PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT. FINALLY, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONCILE THE CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS TO ALIENS WHO ARE DEPORTED FOR AIDING OTHER ALIENS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, EXCEPT UPON THE GROUND THAT CONGRESS FELT THAT THEIR CONDUCT WAS LESS REPREHENSIBLE. AGAIN THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT THE REASON MIGHT BE CONGRESS' BELIEF THAT THESE ALIENS WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT MUST BE REJECTED. FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY WOULD BE AMPLE TIME WITHIN WHICH TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT AND QUALIFY. MOREOVER THE SAME FIVE-YEAR LIMITATION APPLIES TO SEVERAL OF THE 14 GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION FOR WHICH ALIENS ARE CUT OFF FROM BENEFITS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT WOULD APPLY EQUALLY TO THEM IF THAT IN FACT WAS THE CONGRESSIONAL REASON. THIS APPRAISAL OF THE DISTINCTIONS DRAWN BY CONGRESS BETWEEN VARIOUS KINDS OF CONDUCT IMPELS THE CONCLUSION, BEYOND PERADVENTURE THAT THE DISTINCTIONS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY IF THE PURPOSE OF CONGRESS WAS TO STRIKE AT \"THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" THE COURT INVEIGHS AGAINST INVALIDATING A STATUTE ON \"IMPLICATON AND VAGUE CONJECTURE.\" RATHER I THINK THE COURT HAS STRAINED TO SUSTAIN THE STATUTE ON \"IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE,\" IN HOLDING THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WAS \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED.\" TODAY'S DECISION SANCTIONS THE USE OF THE SPENDING POWER NOT TO FURTHER THE LEGITIMATE OBJECTIVES OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM BUT TO INFLICT HURT UPON THOSE WHO BY THEIR CONDUCT HAVE INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF CONGRESS. THE FRAMERS ORDAINED THAT EVEN THE WORST OF MEN SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR PAST ACTS OR FOR ANY CONDUCT WITHOUT ADHERENCE TO THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS WRITTEN INTO THE CONSTITUTION. TODAY'S DECISION IS TO ME A REGRETFUL RETREAT FROM LOVETT, CUMMINGS AND GARLAND.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Workers leave the site of the future Trump International Hotel, which is at the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels.But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project — billionaire developer Donald Trump — put himself at the center of the nation’s debate over illegal immigration.[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]Trump garnered headlines — and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him — when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and “rapists” crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump’s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs — while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments. (The Washington Post)All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.“It’s something ironic,” said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.“The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,” Arellano said in Spanish. “And we’re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.”Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.“Most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,” said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country’s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.“He might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,” Gonzalez said of Trump.1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York. Caption The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination. June 16, 2015 Trump holds a piece of paper with information about his personal finances. Trump, who has toyed with seeking the nation’s highest elected office for years, dismissed the 11 other Republican candidates by declaring that politicians cannot solve the country’s problems. Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Several of the laborers — who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day — fumed at Trump’s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.“Do you think that when we’re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we’re raping or selling drugs?” Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. “We’re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.”In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers.“Our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,” the ­e-mailed statement said.Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, “requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,” the statement said.Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.“Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,” Cohen said in a telephone interview. “That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.”A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.Hicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump’s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.Trump’s comments about illegal immigration — which included a promise to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and bill Mexico for the cost — reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company’s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.The rapid rejection of Trump’s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.Trump’s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country — and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul’s remarks.The NBC television network, the Macy’s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump — part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to “dump Trump” by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump’s hotel.[Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to ‘dump Trump’]At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump’s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel’s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington — with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building’s heyday as the District’s main post office in the early 20th century.Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. “Most of the workers here are migrants,” he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: “I don’t think it’s right, what he said. They’re hard workers.”For David Montoya, 28, Trump’s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. “Every 18 months, I have to get it renewed,” he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story — one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off — is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.“Actually,” he reflected, “we’re more American than him.”</td>\n",

Mississippi's new voter ID law was put to its first test in Tuesday’s primaries. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)Note: This is a guest post by Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and an expert in constitutional law and the law of democracy, with a particular focus on election administration and redistricting.Voter ID laws are back in the news once again, with two new opinions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court late last week dealing with the state's ID requirement, which would allow people to vote only if they provide certain forms of government-issued ID. The Court made some minor changes to the law but otherwise upheld it. However, the ID requirement is still on hold pending a federal lawsuit.Part of this litigation — and any rational debate about the issue generally — hinges on two things: costs and benefits. The costs of these sorts of laws vary, because the laws themselves differ from state to state (some are far more burdensome than others). The ostensible benefits, though, are all the same. And in addressing these purported benefits, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blew it. Twice.First, the court cited the idea that ID laws could enhance public confidence--that is, in theory, the laws might make us feel better about elections in that they might provide some security theater. It turns out, though, that this effect is hard to spot. People in states with more restrictive ID laws don’t generally feel better about their elections than people in more permissive states. People who think elections are being stolen, and people who think they’re not, each hold on to that opinion no matter what the governing ID rules in their area. The factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair? Whether their preferred candidates win.[Here’s the completely legal way to ‘rig’ an election]Second, the court said that ID laws can help stop fraud. It then cited an example of recent fraud … that ID laws aren’t designed to stop. Specifically, it mentioned a case in which a supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including \"registering to vote in more than one place, voting where he didn't live, voting more than once in the same election, and providing false information to election officials,\" according to an account by Talking Points Memo. Wisconsin's ID law would not likely have prevented any of the alleged violations.This sort of misdirection is pretty common, actually. Election fraud happens. But ID laws are not aimed at the fraud you’ll actually hear about. Most current ID laws (Wisconsin is a rare exception) aren’t designed to stop fraud with absentee ballots (indeed, laws requiring ID at the polls push more people into the absentee system, where there are plenty of real dangers). Or vote buying. Or coercion. Or fake registration forms. Or voting from the wrong address. Or ballot box stuffing by officials in on the scam. In the 243-page document that Mississippi State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed on Monday with evidence of allegedly illegal votes in the Mississippi Republican primary, there were no allegations of the kind of fraud that ID can stop.Instead, requirements to show ID at the polls are designed for pretty much one thing: people showing up at the polls pretending to be somebody else in order to each cast one incremental fake ballot. This is a slow, clunky way to steal an election. Which is why it rarely happens.I’ve been tracking allegations of fraud for years now, including the fraud ID laws are designed to stop. In 2008, when the Supreme Court weighed in on voter ID, I looked at every single allegation put before the Court. And since then, I’ve been following reports wherever they crop up.[New evidence that voter ID laws 'skew democracy' in favor of white Republicans]To be clear, I’m not just talking about prosecutions. I track any specific, credible allegation that someone may have pretended to be someone else at the polls, in any way that an ID law could fix.So far, I’ve found about 31 different incidents (some of which involve multiple ballots) since 2000, anywhere in the country. If you want to check my work, you can read a comprehensive list of the incidents below.To put this in perspective, the 31 incidents below come in the context of general, primary, special, and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014. In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period.Some of these 31 incidents have been thoroughly investigated (including some prosecutions). But many have not. Based on how other claims have turned out, I’d bet that some of the 31 will end up debunked: a problem with matching people from one big computer list to another, or a data entry error, or confusion between two different people with the same name, or someone signing in on the wrong line of a pollbook.In just four states that have held just a few elections under the harshest ID laws, more than 3,000 votes (in general elections alone) have reportedly been affirmatively rejected for lack of ID. (That doesn’t include voters without ID who didn’t show up, or recordkeeping mistakes by officials.) Some of those 3,000 may have been fraudulent ballots. But how many legitimate voters have already been turned away?Correction: Justin Levitt is a professor with Loyola Law School, Los Angeles; not the Loyola University Law School.Credible allegations of potential fraud since 2000 that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the pollsNote: tracking the allegations — even those that may end up disproven — can help calibrate an upper bound for the actual existing fraud that ID laws would stop. I am a researcher, and so I am interested in a thorough list: if you have credible information about a specific individual whose vote was stolen by an impersonator at the polls, please tell me. Specific and credible means just that. Not — please — examples like this. And if you have information about an incident below that indicates that it was error rather than fraud, please tell me that as well.May 2014: Ben Hodzic allegedly voted at the polls in the name of his brother in the Catskill School District Board of Education election in Catskill, NY.[1] Nov. 2013: Mark Atlas allegedly voted at the polls in the name of someone else in the municipal election in Worcester, MA.[2] Sep. 2013: At least four, and possibly 20-24, Hasidic voters in the South Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, allegedly attempted to vote at the polls under others’ names in the municipal primary elections for New York City.[3] Mar. 2013: Kristina Bentrim went to vote at the polls in the Cedar Rapids, IA, special election on a gambling referendum, and was allegedly told that someone had voted in her name.[4] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Angela Cooney in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Angela Cooney listed as dying 4 years earlier.[5] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Evan Dixon in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Evan Dixon listed as dying 11 years earlier.[6] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Alejandro Guerrero in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Alejandro Guerrero listed as dying 5 years earlier.[7] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. 2012: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2012 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney.[8] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. June 2011: Hazel Brionne Woodard apparently arranged for her son Mark James Jr. to vote at the polls in the name of his father, Mark James Sr., in the municipal runoff elections in Tarrant County, TX.[9] Nov. 2010: Four ballots may have been cast in the general election in South Carolina in the name of voters who had previously died (Ed Louis Johnson, Elbert R. Thompson, Ruth Middleton, and James L. Warnock); election and law enforcement officials had insufficient information to come to a final conclusion, including two pollbook pages that were unavailable. (Law enforcement agents believe that the ballot of Elbert R. Thompson may have been confused with that of his son, Elbert Thompson.) Another 203 allegations of deceased voters in the same election were revealed to be either clerical error or coincidence.[10] May 2009: Lorenzo Antonio Almanza, Jr., after voting himself, apparently cast a ballot at the polls in the name of his incarcerated brother, Orlando Almanza, in the 2009 election for the Progreso Independent School District Board, TX. (His mother, Reyna Almanza, vouched for him, and was separately convicted.)[11] Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Forrest Downie in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Forrest Downie listed as dying 3 years earlier.[12] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Scott Hagloch in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Scott Hagloch listed as dying 2 years earlier.[13] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Mar. 2008: Jack Carol Crowder III allegedly impersonated his father (Jack Carol Crowder), using his father’s voter registration card at the polls in the March 2008 presidential primary election in Baytown, TX.[14] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of James E. Barnes, who died in 2006. This may (or may not) have been the result of clerical error confusing the man with his son, James W. Barnes; it is not clear whether the pollbooks were reviewed to determine whether fraud or clerical error was the cause.[15] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of Stanley Dwayne Echols, who was at the hospital and did not vote.[16] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. June 2007: The two contending city council candidates in a municipal runoff election in Hoboken, NJ, both reported instances in the election in which someone went to the polls and found out that someone else had voted in their place.[17] It is not clear how many instances there were, or how the candidates learned of them. It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in a municipal budget referendum in Stonington, CT, in the name of Jane M. Drury, who died in 2000.[18] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Rosalie B. Simpson died in August 2004, but a vote was apparently recorded at the polls in her name in the general election in Seattle, WA.[19] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Frank Sanchez, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[20] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Someone apparently signed on the pollbook line for Rose-Mary G. McGee, in Albuquerque, NM, during the general election.[21] Nov. 2004: Dwight Adkins, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[22] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Three people at the polls in Westchester County, NY, were given provisional ballots (in New York, “affidavit ballots”) in the general election because someone had allegedly signed the poll books in their place.[23] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. Nov. 2004: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the general election in Milwaukee, WI, in the name of an individual who had died several years earlier.[24] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2004: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2004 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney. [25] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. Jan. 2004: Mark Lacasse apparently voted at the polls in the presidential primary in Londonderry, NH, in the name of his father, who was away on business at the time. [26] Nov. 2002: Shasta Nicole Crayton apparently voted in her sister’s name at the polls in the general election in Dadeville, AL.[27] In several municipal, primary, and general elections in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011, votes were cast in-person in Philadephia, PA, by an individual named Joseph Cheeseboro and by an individual named Joseph J. Cheeseborough. There is apparently some doubt about where one or both names represent real identities.[28] In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 44 individuals with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers matching the information of individuals listed as incarcerated were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[29] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the incarceration records or the voting records. In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 145 individuals with names, dates of birth, and addresses matching the information of individuals listed as deceased were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[30] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the death records or the voting records. According to Texas Director of Elections Keith Ingram, the names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of four “recent” voters allegedly matched the corresponding information on earlier death certificates, indicating that the votes were cast after the individuals’ deaths. It is not clear at which elections these votes were cast, or how many, if any, of these votes were cast at the polls (rather than absentee). It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error.[31]Credible allegations of impersonation at the polls since 2000 that would not likely be prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls, or attempted impersonation at the polls since 2000 that was actually prevented without a strict ID requirement(Note: these allegations do not include other forms of fraud not prevented by a requirement to show ID at the polls, including absentee ballot fraud, vote buying, vote coercion, fraud in the tallying process, voter registration fraud, double voting, voting by nonresidents, voting by noncitizens, voting by persons disenfranchised by conviction, or fraud in the petitioning process.)Nov. 2012: Linda Earlette Wells apparently voted at the polls in the general election in Germantown, MD, in the name of her mother (Beatrice Moore Wells), who had died in June 2011. She apparently used her mother’s ID to cast the ballot.[32] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Caitlin A. Legacki in the general election; Legacki was in Missouri at the time. However, in 2012, New Hampshire had a requirement that voters show photo ID at the polls; officials believe that either someone showed a fraudulent ID in Legacki’s name or (according to them, more likely) that a clerical error incorrectly listed Legacki as voting.[33] Nov. 2010 (and Nov. 2008): Ortencia Segura-Segura apparently voted at the polls in the name of Marisela Reyna in the general elections in Reno, NV, using a fraudulently procured Nevada driver’s license.[34] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Mar. 2010: Delores McMillian and her mother were both election officials in Dallas. During the primary election, McMillian used one other voter’s registration number to try to cast a ballot in her name. (Her mother may have used more, but died during the course of the investigation.) A fellow election worker apparently blocked the attempt.[35] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. Nov. 2008 (and others): Mary Ann Comparin used a fake driver’s license in the name of her long-dead sister, Norma Gerrish Collins, to vote in her sister’s name in the 2008 general election in Bexar County, TX. [36] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2008: Ricardo Lopez-Munguia apparently voted (whether absentee or in person is not clear) in the name of Gustavo Carranza-Madrigal in the general election in Escondido, CA. Lopez-Munguia possessed a fraudulent California driver’s license.[37] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: Andrea Peña was apparently recruited by mayor Omar Vela to vote in the school board election in Progreso, TX; Peña was apparently given someone else’s voter registration card and told that pollworkers would make sure there were no problems. An election judge (more usually known as a pollworker) actually cast Peña’s ballot for her.[38] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: in the same Progreso school board election, Jessica Rangel claimed that Guadalupe Vela Sr. tried to convince Rangel to recruit a friend to vote with someone else’s voter registration card, and claimed that “they had people that worked the election on their side.” Rangel apparently refused.[39] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Aug. 2007: Vancy Voorhies, a pollworker in Davidson County, TN, apparently voted at the polls in the mayoral election; at her ill elderly cousin’s request, she signed her cousin’s name in the pollbook (with her own initials to indicate the permission), asked her cousin how she preferred to vote, and cast the ballot accordingly.[40] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a misguided pollworker from casting invalid ballots. June 2007: A homeless man was apparently paid $10 to use the name of Kevin Logan to vote in a city council runoff race in Hoboken, NJ. After a challenge by a local resident, the effort failed. [41] Sept. 2005: Memphis, TN, pollworkers Verline Mayo, Gertrude Otteridge, and Mary McClatcher apparently cast at least three votes at the polls in the names of others, including two in the names of dead voters, in a special election for a state Senate seat.[42] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. May 2005: Macon, MS, resident Kendrick Slaughter testified that he saw Ike Brown, chairman of the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee, urging Bridgette Brown to “go in [to the precinct pollsite] and vote, to use any name, and that no one was going to say anything.” It is not clear whether Bridgette Brown did cast a vote at the polls in the name of another, but it is clear that pollworkers under Ike Brown’s direction stood ready to commit or facilitate other forms of voter fraud.[43] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2000: A vote was cast in the general election in Miami, FL, in the name of Andre Alismé, who had died in 1997. The voter apparently used either a passport or driver’s license and a voter registration card in Alismé’s name.[44][1] Jim Planck, Alleged Fraud Casts Pall Over Catskill School Vote, Daily Mail, May 29, 2014.[2] Alli Knothe, 2 Charged with Voter Fraud in Worcester, Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette, Dec. 4, 2013.[3] Max Rivlin-Nadler et al., Brazen Voting Fraud Alleged Among Ultra-Orthodox in Williamsburg, Gothamist, Sep. 11, 2013, http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/voter_fraud_attempts.php.[4] Jason Noble, Schultz, Many Iowans Still Solidly Back Voter ID Laws, Des Moines Register, Dec. 15, 2013.[5] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[6] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[7] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[8] N.C.

PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

                                           Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government. In the past two weeks, after receiving a...“NOS” stands for “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama’s campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama’s “team” has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation’s capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place — along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC — is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama’s military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren’t your friends. Get out of the house and don’t look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves.  \n",

This time it was during the YouTube shooting reporting by local liberal news channels.As the media ran to drive a narrative home today after the Youtube headquarters shooting one San Francisco Bay Area resident and employee of YouTube decided to say what he was really thinking. Instead of saying the same old things someone from Liberal Silicon Valley would say he said that every red-blooded American should be thinking when caught up in a shootout.Witness at San Bruno YouTube headquarters shooting. “I didn’t have a gun on me but wish I did” pic.twitter.com/jP6v9uOlpa — ᏢᏒᎥsᏟᎥᏞᏞᎪ’s ᏉᎥᎬᎳ ™️ (@PriscillasView) April 3, 2018“When asked what was going through his mind, the witness stated, “I knew I had to be smart. You gotta be smart, you gotta be fast.”The witness also added, “I didn’t have a gun on me, but I wish I did.”He said he wished he had a gun. And that’s the way he should feel. And that’s what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution. They wanted for us to live as free people and to never have to ask anyone permission when it came to owning a firearm. And no, they didn’t just mean muskets like you liberals keep trying to tell us. ‘Wow.. they will run this poor man out of looney California! — al_waisman (@al_waisman) April 4, 2018Reports are confirming that this particular shooting was just a disgruntled woman who wanted to kill her boyfriend, which would potentially make the event a case of domestic violence. And Law enforcement officials do not appear to be treating the incident as an act of terrorism. But what I would like to know is how this woman ended up with a gun.California is known for their strict gun control. We law abiding Californians have to just through hoops to buy a firearm. We eve have to wait 14 days to buy a .22lr bolt action rifle, not unlike the ones parents would gift their 12-year-old sons in the 50’s. Not to mention starting last year we will also need to get a permit, which cost $50 a year to buy ammo, and our ammo will be counted and have serial numbers. But nevermind the fact you can buy any gun for pennies on the dollar in some areas of Oakland and Stockton.I am sure once politicians ban all guns for us law-abiding gun owners, violent criminals will soon follow suit and also surrender their firearms… they just need the motivation to do so and maybe hug, that’s all.The shooter has now been identified via ABC 30SAN BRUNO, Calif. — Sources confirm to our sister station ABC7 News, that the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has an alleged website with a manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.Aghdam is said to have no relationship with anyone in the YouTube facility.Sources say Aghdam did not have an ID badge but was carrying a purse. Nobody in the facility knew who she was. They added that Aghdam got off 30 or 40 shots before turning the gun on herself.According to her website, a possible motivation for the shooting could have been tied to her many YouTube accounts, which she says have seen a decline in viewership over the past few months.Police and witnesses say a woman opened fire Tuesday at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, wounding three people before fatally shooting herself as terrified employees huddled inside.She embedded videos from the biggest YouTubers on the platform on the site, including massive creator Casey Neistat. In them, they talk about the YouTube “Ad-apocalypse” where many users are seeing massive dips in traffic, subscriber count loss, and de-monetization of videos.Neistat has more than 9,000,000 subscribers and made a famous video about the YouTube ad revenue scare for creators.It appears that Aghdam was disgruntled by the changes in the YouTube platform. She wrote on her website, “Be aware! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for personal and short-term profits and do anything to reach their goals even by fooling simple-minded people, hiding the truth, manipulating science and everything, putting public mental and physical health at risk, abusing non-human animals, polluting the environment, destroying family values, promoting materialism and sexual degeneration in the name of freedom and turning people into programmed robots!”She goes on to quote Adolf Hitler saying, “Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it and eventually they will believe it.”The rest of her message targets YouTube and censorship. “There is no free speech in the real world and you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not supported by the system. Videos of targeted users are filtered and merely relegated so that people can hardly see their videos.”February 20, YouTube enacted a new advertising policy that demonetized channels with less than 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time. Though Aghdam’s main English channel had more than 15,000 subscribers, many of her videos appeared to be demonetized.  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. It’s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. I’m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm, he says as he plows toward the ballroom.Inside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson’s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable womana former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband’s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.The room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson scripta bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. I was telling one of my buddies up there, You know, it’s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.’ And he says, Well, don’t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.’ Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. And then he says, Thompson, you got it all covered.’ Everyone laughs.Today, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. We can’t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We’ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can’t prove they’re terrorists within 24 hours, you’ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain’t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.Someone shouts Go, Fred, go.Now it’s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. People talk about the last election. They say, The war, the war, the war,’ Thompson says with a sigh. I think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it’s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made partnership with the alligators instead.A minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. Maybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues. The applause builds to a standing ovation. You know, I had another comment or two, Thompson says, but I think that’s the perfect place to stop.Thompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. You know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete, Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. Without raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I’ve already saved $50 million this year. Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.Since announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson’s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn’t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.  \n",

       "412  Supreme Court Case: Flemming vs. NestorBackground to the Case:The fact that workers contribute to the Social Security program's funding through a dedicated payroll tax establishes a unique connection between those tax payments and future benefits. More so than general federal income taxes can be said to establish \"rights\" to certain government services. This is often expressed in the idea that Social Security benefits are \"an earned right.\" This is true enough in a moral and political sense. But like all federal entitlement programs, Congress can change the rules regarding eligibility--and it has done so many times over the years. The rules can be made more generous, or they can be made more restrictive. Benefits which are granted at one time can be withdrawn, as for example with student benefits, which were substantially scaled-back in the 1983 Amendments.There has been a temptation throughout the program's history for some people to suppose that their FICA payroll taxes entitle them to a benefit in a legal, contractual sense. That is to say, if a person makes FICA contributions over a number of years, Congress cannot, according to this reasoning, change the rules in such a way that deprives a contributor of a promised future benefit. Under this reasoning, benefits under Social Security could probably only be increased, never decreased, if the Act could be amended at all. Congress clearly had no such limitation in mind when crafting the law. Section 1104 of the 1935 Act, entitled \"RESERVATION OF POWER,\" specifically said: \"The right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of this Act is hereby reserved to the Congress.\" Even so, some have thought that this reservation was in some way unconstitutional. This is the issue finally settled by Flemming v. Nestor.In this 1960 Supreme Court decision Nestor's denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving benefits. Under a 1954 law, Social Security benefits were denied to persons deported for, among other things, having been a member of the Communist party. Accordingly, Mr. Nestor's benefits were terminated. He appealed the termination arguing, among other claims, that promised Social Security benefits were a contract and that Congress could not renege on that contract. In its ruling, the Court rejected this argument and established the principle that entitlement to Social Security benefits is not contractual right. Flemming V. Nestor Case Name: FLEMMING V. NESTOR 363 U.S. 603 NO. 54. ARGUED FEBRUARY 24, 1960. - DECIDED JUNE 20, 1960. - 169 F. SUPP. 922, REVERSED . THE TERMINATION OF OLD-AGE BENEFITS PAYABLE TO AN ALIEN WHO, AFTER THE DATE OF ITS ENACTMENT (SEPTEMBER 1, 1954), IS DEPORTED UNDER SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT ON ANY ONE OF CERTAIN GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N). APPELLEE, AN ALIEN WHO HAD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN 1955, WAS DEPORTED IN 1956, PURSUANT TO SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. SINCE THIS WAS ONE OF THE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N), HIS OLD-AGE BENEFITS WERE TERMINATED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. HE COMMENCED THIS ACTION IN A SINGLE JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, UNDER SEC. 205(G) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, TO SECURE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THAT ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION. THE DISTRICT COURT HELD THAT SEC. 202(N) DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT AND, THEREFORE, VIOLATED THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. HELD: 1. ALTHOUGH THIS ACTION DREW INTO QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N), IT DID NOT INVOLVE AN INJUNCTION OR OTHERWISE INTERDICT THE OPERATION OF THE STATUTORY SCHEME; 28 U.S.C. SEC. 2282, FORBIDDING THE ISSUANCE OF AN INJUNCTION RESTRAINING THE ENFORCEMENT, OPERATION OR EXECUTION OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS FOR REPUGNANCE TO THE CONSTITUTION, EXCEPT BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, WAS NOT APPLICABLE; AND JURISDICTION OVER THE ACTION WAS PROPERLY EXERCISED BY THE SINGLE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT. PP. 606-608. 2. A PERSON COVERED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT HAS NOT SUCH A RIGHT IN OLD-AGE BENEFIT PAYMENTS AS WOULD MAKE EVERY DEFEASANCE OF \"ACCRUED\" INTERESTS VIOLATIVE OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. PP. 608-611. (A) THE NONCONTRACTUAL INTEREST OF AN EMPLOYEE COVERED BY THE ACT CANNOT BE SOUNDLY ANALOGIZED TO THAT OF THE HOLDER OF AN ANNUITY, WHOSE RIGHTS TO BENEFITS ARE BASED ON HIS CONTRACTUAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS. PP. 608-610. (B) TO ENGRAFT UPON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM A CONCEPT OF \"ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHTS\" WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER-CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS AND WHICH CONGRESS PROBABLY HAD IN MIND WHEN IT EXPRESSLY RESERVED THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION OF THE ACT. PP. 610-611. 3. SECTION 202(N) OF THE ACT CANNOT BE CONDEMNED AS SO LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION AS TO OFFEND DUE PROCESS. PP. 611-612. 4. TERMINATION OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS UNDER SEC. 202(N) DOES NOT AMOUNT TO PUNISHING HIM WITHOUT A TRIAL, IN VIOLATION OF ART. III, SEC. 2, CL. 3, OF THE CONSTITUTION OR THE SIXTH AMENDMENT; NOR IS SEC. 202(N) A BILL OF ATTAINDER OR EX POST FACTO LAW, SINCE ITS PURPOSE IS NOT PUNITIVE. PP. 612-621. FLEMMING , SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE, V. NESTOR . APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. MR. JUSTICE HARLAN DELIVERED THE OPINON OF THE COURT. FROM A DECISION OF THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOLDING SEC. 202(N) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (68 STAT. 1083, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(N)) UNCONSTITUTIONAL, THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE TAKES THIS DIRECT APPEAL PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. SEC. 1252. THE CHALLENGED SECTION, SET FORTH IN FULL IN THE MARGIN, (FN1) PROVIDES FOR THE TERMINATION OF OLD-AGE, SURVIVOR, AND DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS PAYABLE TO, OR IN CERTAIN CASES IN RESPECT OF, AN ALIEN INDIVIDUAL WHO, AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 1954 (THE DATE OF ENACTMENT OF THE SECTION), IS DEPORTED UNDER SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (8 U.S.C. SEC. 1251A)) ON ANY ONE OF CERTAIN GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N). APPELLEE, AN ALIEN, IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913, AND BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN NOVEMBER 1955. IN JULY 1956 HE WAS DEPORTED PURSUANT TO SEC. 241(A)(6)(C)(I) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. THIS BEING ONE OF THE BENEFIT TERMINATION DEPORTATION GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN SEC. 202(N), APPELLEE'S BENEFITS WERE TERMINATED SOON THEREAFTER, AND NOTICE OF THE TERMINATION WAS GIVEN TO HIS WIFE, WHO HAD REMAINED IN THIS COUNTRY. (FN2) UPON HIS FAILURE TO OBTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE REVERSAL OF THE DECISION, APPELLEE COMMENCED THIS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT, PURSUANT TO SEC. 205(G) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT (53 STAT. 1370, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 405(G)), TO SECURE JUDICIAL REVIEW. (FN3) ON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, THE DISTRICT COURT RULED FOR APPELLEE, HOLDING SEC. 202(N) UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT IN THAT IT DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT. 169 F. SUPP. 922. THE SECRETARY PROSECUTED AN APPEAL TO THIS COURT, AND, SUBJECT TO A JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION HEREINAFTER DISCUSSED, WE SET THE CASE DOWN FOR PLENARY HEARING. 360 U.S. 915. THE PRELIMINARY JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION IS WHETHER 28 U.S.C. SEC. 2282 IS APPLICABLE, AND THEREFORE REQUIRED THAT THE CASE BE HEARD BELOW BEFORE THREE JUDGES, RATHER THAN BY A SINGLE JUDGE, AS IT WAS. SECTION 2282 FORBIDS THE ISSUANCE, EXCEPT BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT, OF ANY \"INTERLOCUTORY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION RESTRAINING THE ENFORCEMENT, OPERATION OR EXECUTION OF ANY ACT OF CONGRESS FOR REPUGNANCE TO THE CONSTITUTION ... .\" NEITHER PARTY REQUESTED A THREE-JUDGE COURT BELOW, AND IN THIS COURT BOTH PARTIES ARGUE THE INAPPLICABILITY OF SEC. 2282. IF THE PROVISION APPLIES, WE CANNOT REACH THE MERITS, BUT MUST VACATE THE JUDGMENT BELOW AND REMAND THE CASE FOR CONSIDERATION BY A THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT. SEE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION V. THE DARLINGTON, INC., 352 U.S. 977. UNDER THE DECISIONS OF THIS COURT, THIS SEC. 205(G) ACTION COULD, AND DID, DRAW IN QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N). SEE, E.G., ANNISTON MFG. CO. V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 337, 345-346. HOWEVER, THE ACTION DID NO MORE. IT DID NOT SEEK AFFIRMATIVELY TO INTERDICT THE OPERATION OF A STATUTORY SCHEME. A JUDGMENT FOR THE APPELLEE WOULD NOT PUT THE OPERATION OF A FEDERAL STATUTE UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF AN EQUITY DECREE; INDEED, APART FROM ITS EFFECT UNDER THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS, IT WOULD HAVE NO OTHER RESULT THAN TO REQUIRE THE PAYMENT OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE THINK THAT WHAT WAS SAID IN GARMENT WORKERS V. DONNELLY CO., 304 U.S. 243, WHERE THIS COURT DEALT WITH AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION, IS CONTROLLING HERE: \"THE PREDECESSOR OF SEC. 2282 DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR A CASE WHERE THE VALIDITY OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS IS MERELY DRAWN IN QUESTION, ALBEIT THAT QUESTION BE DECIDED, BUT ONLY FOR A CASE WHERE THERE IS AN APPLICATION FOR AN INTERLOCUTORY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION TO RESTRAIN THE ENFORCEMENT OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS ... . HAD CONGRESS INTENDED THE PROVISION ... , FOR THREE JUDGES AND DIRECT APPEAL, TO APPLY WHENEVER A QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF AN ACT OF CONGRESS BECAME INVOLVED, CONGRESS WOULD NATURALLY HAVE USED THE FAMILIAR PHRASE 'DRAWN IN QUESTION' ... .\" ID., AT 250. WE HOLD THAT JURISDICTION OVER THE ACTION WAS PROPERLY EXERCISED BY THE DISTRICT COURT, AND THEREFORE REACH THE MERITS. I. WE THINK THAT THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT SEC. 202(N) DEPRIVED APPELLEE OF AN \"ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHT.\" 169 F. SUPP., AT 934. APPELLEE'S RIGHT TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS CANNOT PROPERLY BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN OF THAT ORDER. THE GENERAL PURPOSES UNDERLYING THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT WERE EXPOUNDED BY MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO IN HELVERING V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 619, 640-645. THE ISSUE HERE, HOWEVER, REQUIRES SOME INQUIRY INTO THE STATUTORY SCHEME BY WHICH THOSE PURPOSES ARE SOUGHT TO BE ACHIEVED. PAYMENTS UNDER THE ACT ARE BASED UPON THE WAGE EARNER'S RECORD OF EARNINGS IN EMPLOYMENT OR SELF-EMPLOYMENT COVERED BY THE ACT, AND TAKE THE FORM OF OLD-AGE INSURANCE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS INURING TO THE WAGE EARNER (KNOWN AS THE \"PRIMARY BENEFICIARY\"), AND OF BENEFITS, INCLUDING SURVIVOR BENEFITS, PAYABLE TO NAMED DEPENDENTS (\"SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES\") OF A WAGE EARNER. BROADLY SPEAKING, ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS DEPENDS ON SATISFYING STATUTORY CONDITIONS AS TO (1) EMPLOYMENT IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT OR SELF-EMPLOYMENT (SEE SEC. 210(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 410(A)); (2) THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF \"QUARTERS OF COVERAGE\" - I.E., THREE-MONTH PERIODS DURING WHICH NOT LESS THAN A STATED SUM WAS EARNED - THE NUMBER DEPENDING GENERALLY ON AGE (SEE SECS. 213-215, 42 U.S.C. SECS. 413-415); AND (3) ATTAINMENT OF THE RETIREMENT AGE (SEE SEC. 216(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 416(A)). SEC. 202(A), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(A). (FN4) ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS ONCE GAINED IS PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY LOST IF THE BENEFICIARY EARNS MORE THAN A STATED ANNUAL SUM, UNLESS HE OR SHE IS AT LEAST 72 YEARS OLD. SEC. 203(B), (E), 42 U.S.C. SEC. 403(B), (E). OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE IS THE FACT THAT ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS, AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH BENEFITS, DO NOT IN ANY TRUE SENSE DEPEND ON CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, BUT RATHER ON THE EARNINGS RECORD OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE PROGRAM IS FINANCED THROUGH A PAYROLL TAX LEVIED ON EMPLOYEES IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT, AND ON THEIR EMPLOYERS. THE TAX RATE, WHICH IS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRST $4,800 OF EMPLOYEE ANNUAL INCOME, IS SET AT A SCALE WHICH WILL INCREASE FROM YEAR TO YEAR, PRESUMABLY TO KEEP PACE WITH RISING BENEFIT COSTS. I.R.C. OF 1954, SECS. 3101, 3111, 3121(A). THE TAX PROCEEDS ARE PAID INTO THE TREASURY \"AS INTERNAL REVENUE COLLECTIONS,\" I.R.C., SEC. 3501, AND EACH YEAR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE PROCEEDS IS APPROPRIATED TO A TRUST FUND, FROM WHICH BENEFITS AND THE EXPENSES OF THE PROGRAM ARE PAID. SEC. 201, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401. IT WAS EVIDENTLY CONTEMPLATED THAT RECEIPTS WOULD GREATLY EXCEED DISBURSEMENTS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM, AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND THE INCOME RETURNED TO THE TRUST FUND. THUS, PROVISION IS MADE FOR EXPECTED INCREASING COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM MAY BE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED AS A FORM OF SOCIAL INSURANCE, ENACTED PURSUANT TO CONGRESS' POWER TO \"SPEND MONEY IN AID OF THE 'GENERAL WELFARE,'\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 640, WHEREBY PERSONS GAINFULLY EMPLOYED, AND THOSE WHO EMPLOY THEM, ARE TAXED TO PERMIT THE PAYMENT OF BENEFITS TO THE RETIRED AND DISABLED, AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. PLAINLY THE EXPECTATION IS THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE PRESENT PRODUCTIVE WORK FORCE WILL IN TURN BECOME BENEFICIARIES RATHER THAN SUPPORTERS OF THE PROGRAM. BUT EACH WORKER'S BENEFITS, THOUGH FLOWING FROM THE CONTRIBUTIONS HE MADE TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY WHILE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED, ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH HE WAS CALLED UPON TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM BY TAXATION. IT IS APPARENT THAT THE NONCONTRACTUAL INTEREST OF AN EMPLOYEE COVERED BY THE ACT CANNOT BE SOUNDLY ANALOGIZED TO THAT OF THE HOLDER OF AN ANNUITY, WHOSE RIGHT TO BENEFITS IS BOTTOMED ON HIS CONTRACTUAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS. IT IS HARDLY PROFITABLE TO ENGAGE IN CONCEPTUALIZATIONS REGARDING \"EARNED RIGHTS\" AND GRATUITIES.\" CF. LYNCH V. UNITED STATES, 292 U.S. 571, 576-577. THE \"RIGHT\" TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IS IN ONE SENSE \"EARNED,\" FOR THE ENTIRE SCHEME RESTS ON THE LEGISLATIVE JUDGMENT THAT THOSE WHO IN THEIR PRODUCTIVE YEARS WERE FUNCTIONING MEMBERS OF THE ECONOMY MAY JUSTLY CALL UPON THAT ECONOMY, IN THEIR LATER YEARS, FOR PROTECTION FROM \"THE RIGORS OF THE POOR HOUSE AS WELL AS FROM THE HAUNTING FEAR THAT SUCH A LOT AWAITS THEM WHEN JOURNEY'S END IS NEAR.\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 641. BUT THE PRACTICAL EFFECTUATION OF THAT JUDGMENT HAS OF NECESSITY CALLED FORTH A HIGHLY COMPLEX AND INTERRELATED STATUTORY STRUCTURE. INTEGRATED TREATMENT OF THE MANIFOLD SPECIFIC PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM DEMANDS MORE THAN A GENERALIZATION. THAT PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO FUNCTION INTO THE INDEFINITE FUTURE, AND ITS SPECIFIC PROVISIONS REST ON PREDICTIONS AS TO EXPECTED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHICH MUST INEVITABLY PROVE LESS THAN WHOLLY ACCURATE, AND ON JUDGMENTS AND PREFERENCES AS TO THE PROPER ALLOCATION OF THE NATION'S RESOURCES WHICH EVOLVING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS WILL OF NECESSITY IN SOME DEGREE MODIFY. TO ENGRAFT UPON THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM A CONCEPT OF \"ACCRUED PROPERTY RIGHTS\" WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER-CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS. SEE WOLLENBERG, VESTED RIGHTS IN SOCIAL-SECURITY BENEFITS, 37 ORE. L. REV. 299, 359. IT WAS DOUBTLESS OUT OF AN AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR SUCH FLEXIBILITY THAT CONGRESS INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL ACT, AND HAS SINCE RETAINED, A CLAUSE EXPRESSLY RESERVING TO IT \"THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION\" OF THE ACT. SEC. 1104, 49 STAT. 648, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 1304. THAT PROVISION MAKES EXPRESS WHAT IS IMPLICIT IN THE INSTITUTIONAL NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM. SEE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, HEARINGS BEFORE A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 83D CONG., 1ST SESS., PP. 920 921. IT WAS PURSUANT TO THAT PROVISION THAT SEC. 202(N) WAS ENACTED. WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT A PERSON COVERED BY THE ACT HAS NOT SUCH A RIGHT IN BENEFIT PAYMENTS AS WOULD MAKE EVERY DEFEASANCE OF \"ACCRUED\" INTERESTS VIOLATIVE OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. II. THIS IS NOT TO SAY, HOWEVER, THAT CONGRESS MAY EXERCISE ITS POWER TO MODIFY THE STATUTORY SCHEME FREE OF ALL CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINT. THE INTEREST OF A COVERED EMPLOYEE UNDER THE ACT IS OF SUFFICIENT SUBSTANCE TO FALL WITHIN THE PROTECTION FROM ARBITRARY GOVERNMENTAL ACTION AFFORDED BY THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. IN JUDGING THE PERMISSIBILITY OF THE CUT-OFF PROVISIONS OF SEC. 202(N) FROM THIS STANDPOINT, IT IS NOT WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONGRESSIONAL JUDGMENT EXPRESSED IN THAT SECTION IS SOUND OR EQUITABLE, OR WHETHER IT COMPORTS WELL OR ILL WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE ACT. \"WHETHER WISDOM OR UNWISDOM RESIDES IN THE SCHEME OF BENEFITS SET FORTH IN TITLE II, IT IS NOT FOR US TO SAY. THE ANSWER TO SUCH INQUIRIES MUST COME FROM CONGRESS, NOT THE COURTS. OUR CONCERN HERE, AS OFTEN, IS WITH POWER, NOT WITH WISDOM.\" HELVERING V. DAVIS, SUPRA, AT 644. PARTICULARLY WHEN WE DEAL WITH A WITHHOLDING OF A NONCONTRACTUAL BENEFIT UNDER A SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS, WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE CAN BE THOUGHT TO INTERPOSE A BAR ONLY IF THE STATUTE MANIFESTS A PATENTLY ARBITRARY CLASSIFICATION, UTTERLY LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION. SUCH IS NOT THE CASE HERE. THE FACT OF A BENEFICIARY'S RESIDENCE ABROAD - IN THE CASE OF A DEPORTEE, A PRESUMABLY PERMANENT RESIDENCE - CAN BE OF OBVIOUS RELEVANCE TO THE QUESTION OF ELIGIBILITY. ONE BENEFIT WHICH MAY BE THOUGHT TO ACCRUE TO THE ECONOMY FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IS THE INCREASED OVER-ALL NATIONAL PURCHASING POWER RESULTING FROM TAXATION OF PRODUCTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE ECONOMY TO PROVIDE PAYMENTS TO THE RETIRED AND DISABLED, WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DESTITUTE OR NEARLY SO, AND WHO WOULD GENERALLY SPEND A COMPARATIVELY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEIR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. THIS ADVANTAGE WOULD BE LOST AS TO PAYMENTS MADE TO ONE RESIDING ABROAD. FOR THESE PURPOSES, IT IS, OF COURSE, CONSTITUTIONALLY IRRELEVANT WHETHER THIS REASONING IN FACT UNDERLAY THE LEGISLATIVE DECISION, AS IT IS IRRELEVANT THAT THE IN LOGIC APPLY. (FN5) SEE UNITED STATES V. PETRILLO, 332 U.S. 1, 8-9; STEWARD MACHINE CO. V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 548, 584-585; CF. CARMICHAEL V. SOUTHERN COAL CO., 301 U.S. 495, 510-513. NOR, APART FROM THIS, CAN IT BE DEEMED IRRATIONAL FOR CONGRESS TO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE PUBLIC PURSE SHOULD NOT BE UTILIZED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUPPORT OF THOSE DEPORTED ON THE GROUNDS SPECIFIED IN THE STATUTE. WE NEED GO NO FURTHER TO FIND SUPPORT FOR OUR CONCLUSION THAT THIS PROVISION OF THE ACT CANNOT BE CONDEMNED AS SO LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION AS TO OFFEND DUE PROCESS. III. THE REMAINING, AND MOST INSISTENTLY PRESSED, CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS REST UPON ART. I, SEC. 9, CL. 3, AND ART. III, SEC. 2, CL. 3, OF THE CONSTITUTION, AND THE SIXTH AMENDMENT. (FN6) IT IS SAID THAT THE TERMINATION OF APPELLEE'S BENEFITS AMOUNTS TO PUNISHING HIM WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL, SEE WONG WING V. UNITED STATES, 163 U.S. 228; THAT THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS CONSTITUTES THE IMPOSITION OF PUNISHMENT BY LEGISLATIVE ACT, RENDERING SEC. 202(N) A BILL OF ATTAINDER\" SEE UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303; CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277; AND THAT THE PUNISHMENT EXACTED IS IMPOSED FOR PAST CONDUCT NOT UNLAWFUL WHEN ENGAGED IN, THEREBY VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION ON EX POST FACTO LAWS, SEE EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333. (FN7) ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF EACH OF THESE CONTENTIONS IS THE VALIDITY OF CHARACTERIZING AS \"PUNISHMENT\" IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS UNDER SEC. 202(N). IN DETERMINING WHETHER LEGISLATION WHICH BASES A DISQUALIFICATION ON THE HAPPENING OF A CERTAIN PAST EVENT IMPOSES A PUNISHMENT, THE COURT HAS SOUGHT TO DISCERN THE OBJECTS ON WHICH THE ENACTMENT IN QUESTION WAS FOCUSED. WHERE THE SOURCE OF LEGISLATIVE CONCERN CAN BE THOUGHT TO BE THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED, THE DISQUALIFICATION IS NOT PUNISHMENT EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BEAR HARSHLY UPON ONE AFFECTED. THE CONTRARY IS THE CASE WHERE THE STATUTE IN QUESTION IS EVIDENTLY AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED. IN THE EARLIEST CASE ON WHICH APPELLEE RELIES, A CLERGYMAN SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED A STATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION BARRING FROM THAT PROFESSION - AND FROM MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS AND OFFICES - ALL WHO WOULD NOT SWEAR THAT THEY HAD NEVER MANIFESTED ANY SYMPATHY OR SUPPORT FOR THE CAUSE OF THE CONFEDERACY. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA. THE COURT THUS DESCRIBED THE AIMS OF THE CHALLENGED ENACTMENT: \"THE OATH COULD NOT ... HAVE BEEN REQUIRED AS A MEANS OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER PARTIES WERE QUALIFIED OR NOT FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE CALLINGS OR THE TRUSTS WITH WHICH THEY WERE CHARGED. IT WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO REACH THE PERSON, NOT THE CALLING. IT WAS EXACTED, NOT FROM ANY NOTION THAT THE SEVERAL ACTS DESIGNATED INDICATED UNFITNESS FOR THE CALLINGS, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE SEVERAL ACTS DESERVED PUNISHMENT ... .\" ID., AT 320. ONLY THE OTHER DAY THE GOVERNING INQUIRY WAS STATED, IN AN OPINION JOINED BY FOUR MEMBERS OF THE COURT, IN THESE TERMS: \"THE QUESTION IN EACH CASE WHERE UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES ARE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON AN INDIVIDUAL FOR PRIOR CONDUCT, IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE AIM WAS TO PUNISH THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR PAST ACTIVITY, OR WHETHER THE RESTRICTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMES ABOUT AS A RELEVANT INCIDENT TO A REGULATION OF A PRESENT SITUATION, SUCH AS THE PROPER QUALIFICATIONS FOR A PROFESSION.\" DE VEAU V. BRAISTED, 363 U.S. 144, 160 (PLURALITY OPINION). IN EX PARTE GARLAND, SUPRA, WHERE THE COURT STRUCK DOWN AN OATH - SIMILAR IN CONTENT TO THAT INVOLVED IN CUMMINGS - REQUIRED OF ATTORNEYS SEEKING TO PRACTICE BEFORE ANY FEDERAL COURT, AS ALSO IN CUMMINGS, THE FINDING OF PUNITIVE INTENT DREW HEAVILY ON THE COURT'S FIRST-HAND ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE EVENTS AND THE MOOD OF THE THEN RECENT CIVIL WAR, AND \"THE FIERCE PASSIONS WHICH THAT STRUGGLE AROUSED.\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 322. (FN8) SIMILARLY, IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, SUPRA, WHERE THE COURT INVALIDATED, AS A BILL OF ATTAINDER, A STATUTE FORBIDDING - SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS - THE FURTHER PAYMENT OF THE SALARIES OF THREE NAMED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, THE DETERMINATION THAT A PUNISHMENT HAD BEEN IMPOSED RESTED IN LARGE MEASURE ON THE SPECIFIC CONGRESSIONAL HISTORY WHICH THE COURT WAS AT PAINS TO SPELL OUT IN DETAIL. SEE 328 U.S., AT 308-312. MOST RECENTLY, IN TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, WHICH HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL A STATUTE PROVIDING FOR THE EXPATRIATION OF ONE WHO HAD BEEN SENTENCED BY A COURT-MARTIAL TO DISMISSAL OR DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE FOR WARTIME DESERTION, THE MAJORITY OF THE COURT CHARACTERIZED THE STATUTE AS PUNITIVE. HOWEVER, NO SINGLE OPINION COMMANDED THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY. THE PLURALITY OPINION RESTED ITS DETERMINATION, AT LEAST IN PART, ON ITS INABILITY TO DISCERN ANY ALTERNATIVE PURPOSE WHICH THE STATUTE COULD BE THOUGHT TO SERVE. ID., AT 97. THE CONCURRING OPINION FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE PROVISION IN QUESTION COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF PUNITIVE INTENT. ID., AT 107-109. IT IS THUS APPARENT THAT, THOUGH THE GOVERNING CRITERION MAY BE READILY STATED, EACH CASE HAS TURNED ON ITS OWN HIGHLY PARTICULARIZED CONTEXT. WHERE NO PERSUASIVE SHOWING OF A PURPOSE \"TO REACH THE PERSON, NOT THE CALLING,\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 320, HAS BEEN MADE, THE COURT HAS NOT HAMPERED LEGISLATIVE REGULATION OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN ITS SPHERE OF CONCERN, DESPITE THE OFTEN-SEVERE EFFECTS SUCH REGULATION HAS HAD ON THE PERSONS SUBJECT TO IT. (FN9) THUS, DEPORTATION HAS BEEN HELD TO BE NOT PUNISHMENT, BUT AN EXERCISE OF THE PLENARY POWER OF CONGRESS TO FIX THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ALIENS ARE TO BE PERMITTED TO ENTER AND REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY. FONG YUE TING V. UNITED STATES, 149 U.S. 698, 730; SEE GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 530-531. SIMILARLY, THE SETTING BY A STATE OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, AND THEIR MODIFICATION FROM TIME TO TIME, IS AN INCIDENT OF THE STATE'S POWER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS, AND ITS DECISION TO BAR FROM PRACTICE PERSONS WHO COMMIT OR HAVE COMMITTED A FELONY IS TAKEN AS EVIDENCING AN INTENT TO EXERCISE THAT REGULATORY POWER, AND NOT A PURPOSE TO ADD TO THE PUNISHMENT OF EX FELONS. HAWKER V. NEW YORK, 170 U.S. 189. SEE DE VEAU V. BRAISTED, SUPRA (REGULATION OF CRIME ON THE WATERFRONT THROUGH DISQUALIFICATION OF EX-FELONS FROM HOLDING UNION OFFICE). CF. HELVERING V. MITCHELL, 303 U.S. 391, 397-401, HOLDING THAT, WITH RESPECT TO DEFICIENCIES DUE TO FRAUD, A 50 PERCENT ADDITION TO THE TAX IMPOSED WAS NOT PUNISHMENT SO AS TO PREVENT, UPON PRINCIPLES OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY, ITS ASSESSMENT AGAINST ONE ACQUITTED OF TAX EVASION. TURNING, THEN, TO THE PARTICULAR STATUTORY PROVISION BEFORE US, APPELLEE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY CONTEND THAT THE LANGUAGE AND STRUCTURE OF SEC. 202(N), OR THE NATURE OF THE DEPRIVATION, REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE A PUNITIVE DESIGN. CF. WONG WING V. UNITED STATES, SUPRA (IMPRISONMENT, AT HARD LABOR UP TO ONE YEAR, OF PERSON FOUND TO BE UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY). HERE THE SANCTION IS THE MERE DENIAL OF A NONCONTRACTUAL GOVERNMENTAL BENEFIT. NO AFFIRMATIVE DISABILITY OR RESTRAINT IS IMPOSED, AND CERTAINLY NOTHING APPROACHING THE \"INFAMOUS PUNISHMENT\" OF IMPRISONMENT, AS IN WONG WING, ON WHICH GREAT RELIANCE IS MISTAKENLY PLACED. MOREOVER, FOR REASONS ALREADY GIVEN (ANTE, PP. 611-612), IT CANNOT BE SAID, AS WAS SAID OF THE STATUTE IN CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 319; SEE DENT V. WEST VIRGINIA, 129 U.S. 114, 126, THAT THE DISQUALIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEPORTEES FROM RECEIPT OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WHILE THEY ARE NOT LAWFULLY IN THIS COUNTRY BEARS NO RATIONAL CONNECTION TO THE PURPOSES OF THE LEGISLATION OF WHICH IT IS A PART, AND MUST WITHOUT MORE THEREFORE BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCING A CONGRESSIONAL DESIRE TO PUNISH. APPELLEE ARGUES, HOWEVER, THAT THE HISTORY AND SCOPE OF SEC. 202(N) PROVE THAT NO SUCH POSTULATED PURPOSE CAN BE THOUGHT TO HAVE MOTIVATED THE LEGISLATURE, AND THAT THEY PERSUASIVELY SHOW THAT A PUNITIVE PURPOSE IN FACT LAY BEHIND THE STATUTE. WE DO NOT AGREE. WE OBSERVE INITIALLY THAT ONLY THE CLEAREST PROOF COULD SUFFICE TO ESTABLISH THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF A STATUTE ON SUCH A GROUND. JUDICIAL INQUIRIES INTO CONGRESSIONAL MOTIVES ARE AT BEST A HAZARDOUS MATTER, AND WHEN THAT INQUIRY SEEKS TO GO BEHIND OBJECTIVE MANIFESTATIONS IT BECOMES A DUBIOUS AFFAIR INDEED. MOREOVER, THE PRESUMPTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY WITH WHICH THIS ENACTMENT, LIKE ANY OTHER, COMES TO US FORBIDS US LIGHTLY TO CHOOSE THAT READING OF THE STATUTE'S SETTING WHICH WILL INVALIDATE IT OVER THAT WHICH WILL SAVE IT. \"IT IS NOT ON SLIGHT IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS TO BE PRONOUNCED TO HAVE TRANSCENDED ITS POWERS, AND ITS ACTS TO BE CONSIDERED AS VOID.\" FLETCHER V. PECK, 6 CRANCH 87, 128. OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. THE PROVISION ORIGINATED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. H.R. 9366, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., SEC. 108. THE DISCUSSION IN THE HOUSE COMMITTEE REPORT, H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., PP. 5, 25, 77, DOES NOT EXPRESS THE PURPOSE OF THE STATUTE. HOWEVER, IT DOES SAY THAT THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS WOULD APPLY TO THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE \"DEPORTED FROM THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY ... .\" ID., AT 25. IT WAS EVIDENTLY THE THOUGHT THAT SUCH WAS THE SCOPE OF THE STATUTE RESULTING FROM ITS APPLICATION TO DEPORTATION UNDER THE 14 NAMED PARAGRAPHS OF SEC. 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT. ID., AT 77. (FN10) THE SENATE COMMITTEE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE STATED REASON THAT IT HAD \"NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SUFFICIENT STUDY TO ALL THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROVISION, WHICH INVOLVES TERMINATION OF BENEFIT RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRIBUTORY PROGRAM OF OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE ... .\" S. REP. NO. 1987, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., P. 23; SEE ALSO ID., AT 76. HOWEVER, IN CONFERENCE, THE PROPOSAL WAS RESTORED IN MODIFIED FORM, (FN11) AND AS MODIFIED WAS ENACTED AS SEC. 202(N). SEE H.R. CONF. REP. NO. 2679, 83D CONG., 2D SESS., P. 18. APPELLEE ARGUES THAT THIS HISTORY DEMONSTRATES THAT CONGRESS WAS NOT CONCERNED WITH THE FACT OF A BENEFICIARY'S DEPORTATION - WHICH IT IS CLAIMED ALONE WOULD JUSTIFY THIS LEGISLATION AS BEING PURSUANT TO A POLICY RELEVANT TO REGULATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM - BUT THAT IT SOUGHT TO REACH CERTAIN GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION, THUS EVIDENCING A PUNITIVE INTENT. (FN12) IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN THE MEAGRE HISTORY THE UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF PUNITIVE INTENT WHICH, UNDER PRINCIPLES ALREADY DISCUSSED, IS REQUIRED BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENT OF THIS KIND MAY BE STRUCK DOWN. EVEN WERE THAT HISTORY TO BE TAKEN AS EVIDENCING CONGRESS' CONCERN WITH THE GROUNDS, RATHER THAN THE FACT, OF DEPORTATION, WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS, STANDING ALONE, WOULD SUFFICE TO ESTABLISH A PUNITIVE PURPOSE. THIS WOULD STILL BE A FAR CRY FROM THE SITUATIONS INVOLVED IN SUCH CASES AS CUMMINGS, WONG WING, AND GARLAND (SEE ANTE, P. 617), AND FROM THAT IN LOVETT, SUPRA, WHERE THE LEGISLATION WAS ON ITS FACE AIMED AT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS. THE LEGISLATIVE RECORD, HOWEVER, FALLS SHORT OF ANY PERSUASIVE SHOWING THAT CONGRESS WAS IN FACT CONCERNED ALONE WITH THE GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION. TO BE SURE CONGRESS DID NOT APPLY THE TERMINATION PROVISION TO ALL DEPORTEES. HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT NEITHER DID IT REST THE OPERATION OF THE STATUTE ON THE OCCURRENCE OF THE UNDERLYING ACT. THE FACT OF DEPORTATION ITSELF REMAINED AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR LOSS OF BENEFITS, AND EVEN IF A BENEFICIARY WERE SAVED FROM DEPORTATION ONLY THROUGH DISCRETIONARY SUSPENSION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER SEC. 244 OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT (66 STAT. 214, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1254), SEC. 202(N) WOULD NOT REACH HIM. MOREOVER, THE GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION REFERRED TO IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT EMBRACE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE DEPORTED, AS IS EVIDENT FROM AN EXAMINATION OF THE FOUR OMITTED GROUNDS, SUMMARIZED IN THE MARGIN. (FN13) INFERENCES DRAWN FROM THE OMISSION OF THOSE GROUNDS CANNOT ESTABLISH, TO THE DEGREE OF CERTAINTY REQUIRED, THAT CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WAS WHOLLY WITH THE ACTS LEADING TO DEPORTATION, AND NOT WITH THE FACT OF DEPORTATION. (FN14) TO HOLD OTHERWISE WOULD BE TO REST ON THE \"SLIGHT IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE\" AGAINST WHICH CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL WARNED. FLETCHER V. PECK, SUPRA, AT 128. THE SAME ANSWER MUST BE MADE TO ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM THE FAILURE OF CONGRESS TO APPLY SEC. 202(N) TO BENEFICIARIES VOLUNTARILY RESIDING ABROAD. BUT CF. SEC. 202(T), ANTE, NOTE 5. CONGRESS MAY HAVE FAILED TO CONSIDER SUCH PERSONS; OR IT MAY HAVE THOUGHT THEIR NUMBER TOO SLIGHT, OR THE PERMANENCE OF THEIR VOLUNTARY RESIDENCE ABROAD TOO UNCERTAIN, TO WARRANT APPLICATION OF THE STATUTE TO THEM, WITH ITS ATTENDANT ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS OF SUPERVISION AND ENFORCEMENT. AGAIN, WE CANNOT WITH CONFIDENCE REJECT ALL THOSE ALTERNATIVES WHICH IMAGINATIVENESS CAN BRING TO MIND, SAVE THAT ONE WHICH MIGHT REQUIRE THE INVALIDATION OF THE STATUTE. REVERSED. FOOTNOTES Footnote 1- SECTION 202(N) PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: \"(N)(1) IF ANY INDIVIDUAL IS (AFTER THE DATE OF ENACTMENT OF THIS SUBSECTION) DEPORTED UNDER PARAGRAPH (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (10), (11), (12), (14), (15), (16), (17), OR (18) OF SECTION 241(A) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT, THEN, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS TITLE: \"(A) NO MONTHLY BENEFIT UNDER THIS SECTION OR SECTION 223 (42 U.S.C.

THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT SHALL BE FINAL EXCEPT THAT IT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW IN THE SAME MANNER AS A JUDGMENT IN OTHER CIVIL ACTIONS.\" Footnote 4- IN ADDITION, ELIGIBILITY FOR DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS IS OF COURSE SUBJECT TO THE FURTHER CONDITION OF THE INCURRING OF A DISABILITY AS DEFINED IN THE ACT.

Footnote 5- THE ACT DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE TERMINATION OF BENEFITS OF NON RESIDENT CITIZENS, OR OF SOME ALIENS WHO LEAVE THE COUNTRY VOLUNTARILY ALTHOUGH MANY NONRESIDENT ALIENS DO LOSE THEIR ELIGIBILITY BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF SEC. 202(T), 70 STAT. 835, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C.

THIS CONTENTION, WHICH IS NO MORE THAN A COLLATERAL ATTACK ON APPELLEE'S DEPORTATION, IS NOT OPEN TO HIM. Footnote 8- SEE ALSO PIERCE V. CARSKADON, 16 WALL. 234.

ON THE AUTHORITY OF CUMMINGS AND GARLAND, THE AMENDMENT WAS INVALIDATED. Footnote 9- AS PRIOR DECISIONS MAKE CLEAR, COMPARE EX PARTE GARLAND, SUPRA, WITH HAWKER V. NEW YORK, SUPRA, THE SEVERITY OF A SANCTION IS NOT DETERMINATIVE OF ITS CHARACTER AS \"PUNISHMENT.\" Footnote 10- PARAGRAPHS (1), (2), AND (10) OF SEC. 241(A) RELATE TO UNLAWFUL ENTRY, OR ENTRY NOT COMPLYING WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS; PARAGRAPHS (6) AND (7) APPLY TO \"SUBVERSIVE\" AND RELATED ACTIVITIES; THE REMAINDER OF THE INCLUDED PARAGRAPHS ARE CONCERNED WITH CONVICTIONS OF DESIGNATED CRIMES, OR THE COMMISSION OF ACTS RELATED TO THEM, SUCH AS NARCOTICS ADDICTION OR PROSTITUTION. Footnote 11- FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE HOUSE VERSION TERMINATION OF BENEFITS OF A DEPORTEE WOULD ALSO HAVE TERMINATED BENEFITS PAID TO SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES BASED ON THE EARNING RECORDS OF THE DEPORTEE. THE CONFERENCE PROPOSAL LIMITED THIS EFFECT TO SECONDARY BENEFICIARIES WHO WERE NONRESIDENT ALIENS. SEE NOTE 2, ANTE. Footnote 12- APPELLEE ALSO RELIES ON THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THE PROPOSED SEC. 108 AND CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS, SOME OF WHICH WERE ENACTED AND SOME OF WHICH WERE NOT. THIS ARGUMENT IS TOO CONJECTURAL TO WARRANT DISCUSSION. IN ADDITION, RELIANCE IS PLACED ON A LETTER WRITTEN TO THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE BY APPELLANT'S PREDECESSOR IN OFFICE, OPPOSING THE ENACTMENT OF WHAT IS NOW SEC. 202(U) OF THE ACT, 70 STAT. 838, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(U), ON THE GROUND THAT THE SECTION WAS \"IN THE NATURE OF A PENALTY AND BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS FOREIGN TO THE OBJECTIVES\" OF THE PROGRAM. SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1955, HEARINGS BEFORE THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, 84TH CONG., 2D SESS., P. 1319. THE SECRETARY WENT ON TO SAY THAT \"PRESENT LAW RECOGNIZES ONLY THREE NARROWLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS (OF WHICH SEC. 202(N) IS ONE) TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT BENEFITS ARE PAID WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ATTITUDES, OPINIONS, BEHAVIOR, OR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ... .\" IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SECRETARY DID NOT SPEAK OF SEC. 202(N) AS A PENALTY, AS HE DID OF THE PROPOSED SEC. 202(U). THE LATTER PROVISION IS CONCEDEDLY PENAL, AND APPLIES ONLY PURSUANT TO A JUDGMENT OF A COURT IN A CRIMINAL CASE. Footnote 13- THEY ARE: (1) PERSONS INSTITUTIONALIZED AT PUBLIC EXPENSE WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY BECAUSE OF \"MENTAL DISEASE, DEFECT, OR DEFICIENCY\" NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ARISEN SUBSEQUENT TO ADMISSION (SEC. 241(A)(3)); (2) PERSONS BECOMING A PUBLIC CHARGE WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY FROM CAUSES NOT SHOWN TO HAVE ARISEN SUBSEQUENT TO ADMISSION SEC. 241(A)(8)); (3) PERSONS ADMITTED AS NONIMMIGRANTS (SEE SEC. 101(A)(15), 66 STAT. 167, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1101(A)(15)) WHO FAIL TO MAINTAIN, OR COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS OF, SUCH STATUS (SEC. 241(A)(9)); (4) PERSONS KNOWINGLY AND FOR GAIN INDUCING OR AIDING, PRIOR TO OR WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY, ANY OTHER ALIEN TO ENTER OR ATTEMPT TO ENTER UNLAWFULLY (SEC. 241(A)(13)). Footnote 14- WERE WE TO ENGAGE IN SPECULATION, IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO CONJECTURE THAT CONGRESS MAY HAVE BEEN LED TO EXCLUDE THESE FOUR GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION OUT OF COMPASSIONATE OR DE MINIMIS CONSIDERATIONS. MR. JUSTICE BLACK, DISSENTING. FOR THE REASONS STATED HERE AND IN THE DISSENTS OF MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS AND MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN I AGREE WITH THE DISTRICT COURT THAT THE UNITED STATES IS DEPRIVING APPELLEE, EPHRAM NESTOR, OF HIS STATUTORY RIGHT TO OLD-AGE BENEFITS IN VIOLATION OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. NESTOR CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913 AND LIVED HERE CONTINUOUSLY FOR 43 YEARS, UNTIL JULY 1956. HE WAS THEN DEPORTED FROM THIS COUNTRY FOR HAVING BEEN A COMMUNIST FROM 1933 TO 1939. AT THAT TIME MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY AS SUCH WAS NOT ILLEGAL AND WAS NOT EVEN A STATUTORY GROUND FOR DEPORTATION. FROM DECEMBER 1936 TO JANUARY 1955 NESTOR AND HIS EMPLOYERS MADE REGULAR PAYMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT, 26 U.S.C. SECS. 3101-3125. THESE FUNDS WENT TO A SPECIAL FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE TRUST FUND UNDER 49 STAT. 622, 53 STAT. 1362, AS AMENDED, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401, IN RETURN FOR WHICH NESTOR, LIKE MILLIONS OF OTHERS, EXPECTED TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS WHEN HE REACHED THE STATUTORY AGE. IN 1954, 15 YEARS AFTER NESTOR HAD LAST BEEN A COMMUNIST, AND 18 YEARS AFTER HE BEGAN TO MAKE PAYMENTS INTO THE OLD-AGE SECURITY FUND, CONGRESS PASSED A LAW PROVIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT ANY PERSON WHO HAD BEEN DEPORTED FROM THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF PAST COMMUNIST MEMBERSHIP UNDER 66 STAT. 205, 8 U.S.C. SEC. 1251(A)(6)(C) SHOULD BE WHOLLY CUT OFF FROM ANY BENEFITS OF THE FUND TO WHICH HE HAD CONTRIBUTED UNDER THE LAW. 68 STAT. 1083, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 402(N). AFTER THE GOVERNMENT DEPORTED NESTOR IN 1956 IT NOTIFIED HIS WIFE, WHO HAD REMAINED IN THIS COUNTRY, THAT HE WAS CUT OFF AND NO FURTHER PAYMENTS WOULD BE MADE TO HIM. THIS ACTION, IT SEEMS TO ME, TAKES NESTOR'S INSURANCE WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION AND IN VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. MOREOVER, IT IMPOSES AN EX POST FACTO LAW AND BILL OF ATTAINDER BY STAMPING HIM, WITHOUT A COURT TRIAL, AS UNWORTHY TO RECEIVE THAT FOR WHICH HE HAS PAID AND WHICH THE GOVERNMENT PROMISED TO PAY HIM. THE FACT THAT THE COURT IS SUSTAINING THIS ACTION INDICATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GO THESE DAYS TO OVERLOOK VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION PERPETRATED AGAINST ANYONE WHO HAS EVER EVEN INNOCENTLY BELONGED TO THE COMMUNIST PARTY. I. IN LYNCH V. UNITED STATES, 292 U.S. 571, THIS COURT UNANIMOUSLY HELD THAT CONGRESS WAS WITHOUT POWER TO REPUDIATE AND ABROGATE IN WHOLE OR IN PART ITS PROMISES TO PAY AMOUNTS CLAIMED BY SOLDIERS UNDER THE WAR RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 1917, SECS. 400-405, 40 STAT. 409. THIS COURT HELD THAT SUCH A REPUDIATION WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT THAT \"NO PERSON SHALL BE ... DEPRIVED OF LIFE, LIBERTY, OR PROPERTY, WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW; NOR SHALL PRIVATE PROPERTY BE TAKEN FOR PUBLIC USE, WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION.\" THE COURT TODAY PUTS THE LYNCH CASE ASIDE ON THE GROUND THAT \"IT IS HARDLY PROFITABLE TO ENGAGE IN CONCEPTUALIZATIONS REGARDING 'EARNED RIGHTS' AND 'GRATUITIES.'\" FROM THIS SOUND PREMISE THE COURT GOES ON TO SAY THAT WHILE \"THE 'RIGHT' TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IS IN ONE SENSE 'EARNED,'\" YET THE GOVERNMENT'S INSURANCE SCHEME NOW BEFORE US RESTS NOT ON THE IDEA OF THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND EARNING SOMETHING, BUT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT THEY MAY \"JUSTLY CALL\" UPON THE GOVERNMENT \"IN THEIR LATER YEARS, FOR PROTECTION FROM 'THE RIGORS OF THE POOR HOUSE AS WELL AS FROM THE HAUNTING FEAR THAT SUCH A LOT AWAITS THEM WHEN JOURNEY'S END IS NEAR.'\" THESE ARE NICE WORDS BUT THEY CANNOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT THEY SIMPLY TELL THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS INSURANCE FUND THAT DESPITE THEIR OWN AND THEIR EMPLOYERS' PAYMENTS THE GOVERNMENT, IN PAYING THE BENEFICIARIES OUT OF THE FUND, IS MERELY GIVING THEM SOMETHING FOR NOTHING AND CAN STOP DOING SO WHEN IT PLEASES. THIS, IN MY JUDGMENT, REVEALS A COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE PURPOSE CONGRESS AND THE COUNTRY HAD IN PASSING THAT LAW. IT WAS THEN GENERALLY AGREED, AS IT IS TODAY, THAT IT IS NOT DESIRABLE THAT AGED PEOPLE THINK OF THE GOVERNMENT AS GIVING THEM SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. AN EXCELLENT STATEMENT OF THIS VIEW, QUOTED BY MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS IN ANOTHER CONNECTION, WAS MADE BY SENATOR GEORGE, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT WAS PASSED, AND ONE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PHILOSOPHY THAT BROUGHT IT ABOUT: \"IT COMPORTS BETTER THAN ANY SUBSTITUTE WE HAVE DISCOVERED WITH THE AMERICAN CONCEPT THAT FREE MEN WANT TO EARN THEIR SECURITY AND NOT ASK FOR DOLES - THAT WHAT IS DUE AS A MATTER OF EARNED RIGHT IS FAR BETTER THAN A GRATUITY ... \"SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT A HANDOUT; IT IS NOT CHARITY; IT IS NOT RELIEF. IT IS AN EARNED RIGHT BASED UPON THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AS AN EARNED RIGHT, THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE HIS BENEFIT IN DIGNITY AND SELF-RESPECT.\" 102 CONG. REC. 15110. THE PEOPLE COVERED BY THIS ACT ARE NOW ABLE TO RELY WITH COMPLETE ASSURANCE ON THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO CONTRIBUTE REGULARLY TO THIS FUND WHENEVER EACH CONTRIBUTION FALLS DUE. I BELIEVE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO RELY WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE ON GETTING THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE PAID FOR AND HAVE BEEN PROMISED, WHEN THEIR DISABILITY OR AGE MAKES THEIR INSURANCE PAYABLE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LAW. THE COURT DID NOT PERMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO BREAK ITS PLIGHTED FAITH WITH THE SOLDIERS IN THE LYNCH CASE; IT SAID THE CONSTITUTION FORBADE SUCH GOVERNMENTAL CONDUCT. I WOULD SAY PRECISELY THE SAME THING HERE. THE COURT CONSOLES THOSE WHOSE INSURANCE IS TAKEN AWAY TODAY, AND OTHERS WHO MAY SUFFER THE SAME FATE IN THE FUTURE, BY SAYING THAT A DECISION REQUIRING THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM TO KEEP FAITH \"WOULD DEPRIVE IT OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS IN ADJUSTMENT TO EVER CHANGING CONDITIONS WHICH IT DEMANDS.\" PEOPLE WHO PAY PREMIUMS FOR INSURANCE USUALLY THINK THEY ARE PAYING FOR INSURANCE, NOT FOR \"FLEXIBILITY AND BOLDNESS.\" I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ANY PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY IN AMERICA WOULD BE PERMITTED TO REPUDIATE ITS MATURED CONTRACTS WITH ITS POLICYHOLDERS WHO HAVE REGULARLY PAID ALL THEIR PREMIUMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE GOOD FAITH OF THE COMPANY. IT IS TRUE, AS THE COURT SAYS, THAT THE ORIGINAL ACT CONTAINED A CLAUSE, STILL IN FORCE, THAT EXPRESSLY RESERVES TO CONGRESS \"THE RIGHT TO ALTER, AMEND, OR REPEAL ANY PROVISION\" OF THE ACT. SEC. 1104, 49 STAT. 648, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 1304. CONGRESS, OF COURSE PROPERLY RETAINED THAT POWER. IT COULD REPEAL THE ACT SO AS TO CEASE TO OPERATE ITS OLD-AGE INSURANCE ACTIVITIES FOR THE FUTURE. THIS MEANS THAT IT COULD STOP COVERING NEW PEOPLE, AND EVEN STOP INCREASING ITS OBLIGATIONS TO ITS OLD CONTRIBUTORS. BUT THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM DISAPPOINTING THE JUST EXPECTATIONS OF THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS COMPELLED THEM AND THEIR EMPLOYERS TO PAY ITS TREASURY. THERE IS NOTHING \"CONCEPTUALISTIC\" ABOUT SAYING, AS THIS COURT DID IN LYNCH, THAT SUCH A TAKING AS THIS THE CONSTITUTION FORBIDS. II. IN PART II OF ITS OPINION, THE COURT THROWS OUT A LINE OF HOPE BY ITS SUGGESTION THAT IF CONGRESS IN THE FUTURE CUTS OFF SOME OTHER GROUP FROM THE BENEFITS THEY HAVE BOUGHT FROM THE GOVERNMENT, THIS COURT MIGHT POSSIBLY HOLD THAT THE FUTURE HYPOTHETICAL ACT VIOLATES THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. IN DOING SO IT READS DUE PROCESS AS AFFORDING ONLY MINIMAL PROTECTION, AND UNDER THIS READING IT WILL PROTECT ALL FUTURE GROUPS FROM DESTRUCTION OF THEIR RIGHTS ONLY IF CONGRESS \"MANIFESTS A PATENTLY ARBITRARY CLASSIFICATION, UTTERLY LACKING IN RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION.\" THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE SO DEFINED PROVIDES LITTLE PROTECTION INDEED COMPARED WITH THE SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS OF THE CONSTITUTION SUCH AS ITS PROHIBITIONS AGAINST TAKING PRIVATE PROPERTY FOR A PUBLIC USE WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION, PASSING EX POST FACTO LAWS, AND IMPOSING BILLS OF ATTAINDER. I CANNOT AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE IS PROPERLY INTERPRETED WHEN IT IS USED TO SUBORDINATE AND DILUTE THE SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND WHEN \"DUE PROCESS\" ITSELF BECOMES SO WHOLLY DEPENDENT UPON THIS COURT'S IDEA OF WHAT IS \"ARBITRARY\" AND \"RATIONAL.\" SEE LEVINE V. UNITED STATES, 362 U.S. 610, 620 (DISSENTING OPINION); ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA, 332 U.S. 46, 89-92 (DISSENTING OPINION); ROCHIN V. CALIFORNIA, 342 U.S. 165, 174 (CONCURRING OPINION). ONE REASON FOR MY BELIEF IN THIS RESPECT IS THAT I AGREE WITH WHAT IS SAID IN THE COURT'S QUOTATION FROM HELVERING V. DAVIS, 301 U.S. 619, 644: \"WHETHER WISDOM OR UNWISDOM RESIDES IN THE SCHEME OF BENEFITS SET FORTH IN TITLE II, IT IS NOT FOR US TO SAY. THE ANSWER TO SUCH INQUIRIES MUST COME FROM CONGRESS, NOT THE COURTS. OUR CONCERN HERE, AS OFTEN, IS WITH POWER, NOT WITH WISDOM.\" AND YET THE COURT'S ASSUMPTION OF ITS POWER TO HOLD ACTS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE THE COURT THINKS THEY ARE ARBITRARY AND IRRATIONAL CAN BE NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN A JUDICIAL FORAY INTO THE FIELD OF GOVERNMENTAL POLICY. BY THE USE OF THIS DUE PROCESS FORMULA THE COURT DOES NOT, AS ITS PROPONENTS FREQUENTLY PROCLAIM, ABSTAIN FROM INTERFERING WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL POLICY. IT ACTIVELY ENTERS THAT FIELD WITH NO STANDARDS EXCEPT ITS OWN CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT IS \"ARBITRARY\" AND WHAT IS \"RATIONAL.\" AND THIS ELASTIC FORMULA GIVES THE COURT A FURTHER POWER, THAT OF HOLDING LEGISLATIVE ACTS CONSTITUTIONAL ON THE GROUND THAT THEY ARE NEITHER ARBITRARY NOR IRRATIONAL, EVEN THOUGH THE ACTS VIOLATE SPECIFIC BILL OF RIGHTS SAFEGUARDS. SEE MY DISSENT IN ADAMSON V. CALIFORNIA, SUPRA. WHETHER THIS ACT HAD \"RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION\" WAS, IN MY JUDGMENT, FOR CONGRESS; WHETHER IT VIOLATES THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL IS FOR US TO DETERMINE, UNLESS WE ARE BY CIRCUMLOCUTION TO ABDICATE THE POWER THAT THIS COURT HAS BEEN HELD TO HAVE EVER SINCE MARBURY V. MADISON, 1 CRANCH 137. III. THE COURT IN PART III OF ITS OPINION HOLDS THAT THE 1954 ACT IS NOT AN EX POST FACTO LAW OR BILL OR ATTAINDER EVEN THOUGH IT CREATES A CLASS OF DEPORTEES WHO CANNOT COLLECT THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE ONCE COMMUNISTS AT A TIME WHEN SIMPLY BEING A COMMUNIST WAS NOT ILLEGAL. THE COURT ALSO PUTS GREAT EMPHASIS ON ITS BELIEF THAT THE ACT HERE IS NOT PUNISHMENT. ALTHOUGH NOT BELIEVING THAT THE PARTICULAR LABEL \"PUNISHMENT\" IS OF DECISIVE IMPORTANCE, I THINK THE ACT DOES IMPOSE PUNISHMENT EVEN IN A CLASSIC SENSE. THE BASIC REASON FOR NESTOR'S LOSS OF HIS INSURANCE PAYMENTS IS THAT HE WAS ONCE A COMMUNIST. THIS MAN, NOW 69 YEARS OLD, HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHERE HE HAS LIVED FOR 43 YEARS TO A LAND WHERE HE IS PRACTICALLY A STRANGER, UNDER AN ACT AUTHORIZING HIS DEPORTATION MANY YEARS AFTER HIS COMMUNIST MEMBERSHIP. CF. GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 532, 533 (DISSENTING OPINIONS). NOW A SIMILAR EX POST FACTO LAW DEPRIVES HIM OF HIS INSURANCE, WHICH, WHILE PETTY AND INSIGNIFICANT IN AMOUNT TO THIS GREAT GOVERNMENT, MAY WELL BE THIS EXILE'S DAILY BREAD, FOR THE SAME REASON AND IN ACCORD WITH THE GENERAL FASHION OF THE DAY - THAT IS, TO PUNISH IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE ANYONE WHO EVER MADE THE MISTAKE OF BEING A COMMUNIST IN THIS COUNTRY OR WHO IS SUPPOSED EVER TO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ANYONE WHO MADE THAT MISTAKE. SEE, E.G., BARENBLATT V. UNITED STATES, 360 U.S. 109, AND UPHAUS V. WYMAN, 360 U.S. 72. IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303, 315-316, WE SAID: \" ... LEGISLATIVE ACTS, NO MATTER WHAT THEIR FORM, THAT APPLY EITHER TO NAMED INDIVIDUALS OR TO EASILY ASCERTAINABLE MEMBERS OF A GROUP IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INFLICT PUNISHMENT ON THEM WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL ARE BILLS OF ATTAINDER PROHIBITED BY THE CONSTITUTION.\" FAITHFUL OBSERVANCE OF OUR HOLDINGS IN THAT CASE, IN EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333, AND IN CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277, WOULD, IN MY JUDGMENT, REQUIRE US TO HOLD THAT THE 1954 ACT IS A BILL OF ATTAINDER. IT IS A CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENT AIMED AT AN EASILY ASCERTAINABLE GROUP; IT IS CERTAINLY PUNISHMENT IN ANY NORMAL SENSE OF THE WORD TO TAKE AWAY FROM ANY PERSON THE BENEFITS OF AN INSURANCE SYSTEM INTO WHICH HE AND HIS EMPLOYER HAVE PAID THEIR MONEYS FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES; AND IT DOES ALL THIS WITHOUT A TRIAL ACCORDING TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW. IT IS TRUE THAT THE LOVETT, CUMMINGS AND GARLAND COURT OPINIONS WERE NOT UNANIMOUS, BUT THEY NONETHELESS REPRESENT POSITIVE PRECEDENTS ON HIGHLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY WHICH SHOULD NOT BE EXPLAINED AWAY WITH COBWEBBERY REFINEMENTS. IF THE COURT IS GOING TO OVERRULE THESE CASES IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AND ADOPT THE VIEWS OF PREVIOUS DISSENTERS, I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE DONE CLEARLY AND FORTHRIGHTLY. A BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITY OF THIS ACT, IN MY JUDGMENT, IS THAT IT IS A PART OF A PATTERN OF LAWS ALL OF WHICH VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT OUT OF FEAR THAT THIS COUNTRY IS IN GRAVE DANGER IF IT LETS A HANDFUL OF COMMUNIST FANATICS OR SOME OTHER EXTREMIST GROUP MAKE THEIR ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSS THEIR IDEAS. THIS FEAR, I THINK, IS BASELESS. IT REFLECTS A LACK OF FAITH IN THE STURDY PATRIOTISM OF OUR PEOPLE AND DOES NOT GIVE TO THE WORLD A TRUE PICTURE OF OUR ABIDING STRENGTH. IT IS AN UNWORTHY FEAR IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS A BILL OF RIGHTS CONTAINING PROVISONS FOR FAIR TRIALS, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, PRESS AND RELIGION, AND OTHER SPECIFIC SAFEGUARDS DESIGNED TO KEEP MEN FREE. I REPEAT ONCE MORE THAT I THINK THIS NATION'S GREATEST SECURITY LIES, NOT IN TRUSTING TO A MOMENTARY MAJORITY OF THIS COURT'S VIEW AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OF WHAT IS \"PATENTLY ARBITRARY,\" BUT IN WHOLEHEARTED DEVOTION TO AND OBSERVANCE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS. SEE WIEMAN V. UPDEGRAFF, 344 U.S. 183, 192 (CONCURRING OPINION). I WOULD AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT WHICH HELD THAT NESTOR IS CONSTITUTIONALLY ENTITLED TO COLLECT HIS INSURANCE. MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, DISSENTING. APPELLEE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM BULGARIA IN 1913 AND WAS EMPLOYED, SO AS TO BE COVERED BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT, FROM DECEMBER 1936 TO JANUARY 1955 - A PERIOD OF 19 YEARS. HE BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR RETIREMENT AND FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS IN NOVEMBER 1955 AND WAS AWARDED $55.60 PER MONTH. IN JULY 1956 HE WAS DEPORTED FOR HAVING BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY FROM 1933 TO 1939. PURSUANT TO A LAW, ENACTED SEPTEMBER 1, 1954, HE WAS THEREUPON DENIED PAYMENT OF FURTHER SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. THIS 1954 LAW SEEMS TO ME TO BE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A BILL OF ATTAINDER, WHICH ART. I, SEC. 9 OF THE CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS CONGRESS FROM ENACTING. A BILL OF ATTAINDER IS A LEGISLATIVE ACT WHICH INFLICTS PUNISHMENT WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, 4 WALL. 277, 323. IN THE OLD DAYS PUNISHMENT WAS METED OUT TO A CREDITOR OR RIVAL OR ENEMY BY SENDING HIM TO THE GALLOWS. BUT AS RECENTLY STATED BY IRVING BRANT: (FN1) \" ... BY SMITING A MAN DAY AFTER DAY WITH SLANDEROUS WORDS, BY TAKING AWAY HIS OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A LIVING, YOU CAN DRAIN THE BLOOD FROM HIS VEINS WITHOUT EVEN SCRATCHING HIS SKIN. \"TODAY'S BILL OF ATTAINDER IS BROADER THAN THE CLASSIC FORM, AND NOT SO TALL AND SHARP. THERE IS MENTAL IN PLACE OF PHYSICAL TORTURE, AND CONFISCATION OF TOMMORROW'S BREAD AND BUTTER INSTEAD OF YESTERDAY'S LAND AND GOLD. WHAT IS PERFECTLY CLEAR IS THAT HATE, FEAR AND PREJUDICE PLAY THE SAME ROLE TODAY, IN THE DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN AMERICA THAT THEY DID IN ENGLAND WHEN A FRENZIED MOB OF LORDS, JUDGES, BISHOPS AND SHOEMAKERS TURNED THE TITUS OATES BLACKLIST INTO A HANGMAN'S RECORD. HATE, JEALOUSY AND SPITE CONTINUE TO FILL THE LEGISLATIVE ATTAINDER LISTS JUST AS THEY DID IN THE IRISH PARLIAMENT OF EX-KING JAMES.\" BILLS OF ATTAINDER, WHEN THEY IMPOSED PUNISHMENT LESS THAN DEATH, WERE BILLS OF PAINS AND PENALTIES AND EQUALLY BEYOND THE CONSTITUTIONAL POWER OF CONGRESS. CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 323. PUNISHMENT IN THE SENSE OF A BILL OF ATTAINDER INCLUDES THE \"DEPRIVATION OR SUSPENSION OF POLITICAL OR CIVIL RIGHTS.\" CUMMINGS V. MISSOURI, SUPRA, AT 322. IN THAT CASE IT WAS BARRING A PRIEST FROM PRACTICING HIS PROFESSION. IN EX PARTE GARLAND, 4 WALL. 333, IT WAS EXCLUDING A MAN FROM PRACTICING LAW IN THE FEDERAL COURTS. IN UNITED STATES V. LOVETT, 328 U.S. 303, IT WAS CUTTING OFF EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION AND BARRING THEM PERMANENTLY FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE. CUTTING OFF A PERSON'S LIVELIHOOD BY DENYING HIM ACCRUED SOCIAL BENEFITS - PART OF HIS PROPERTY INTERESTS - IS NO LESS A PUNISHMENT. HERE, AS IN THE OTHER CASES CITED, THE PENALTY EXACTED HAS ONE OF THE CLASSIC PURPOSES OF PUNISHMENT (FN2) - \"TO REPRIMAND THE WRONGDOER TO DETER OTHERS.\" TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, 96. SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS ARE NOT GRATUITIES. THEY ARE PRODUCTS OF A CONTRIBUTORY SYSTEM, THE FUNDS BEING RAISED BY PAYMENT FROM EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE, OR IN CASE OF SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS, BY THE INDIVIDUAL ALONE. SEE SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD V. NIEROTKO, 327 U.S. 358, 364. THE FUNDS ARE PLACED IN THE FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE TRUST FUND, 42 U.S.C. SEC. 401(A); AND ONLY THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND ARE ENTITLED TO ITS BENEFITS, THE AMOUNT OF BENEFITS BEING RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS MADE. SEE STARK, SOCIAL SECURITY: ITS IMPORTANCE TO LAWYERS, 43 A.B.A.J. 319, 321 (1957). AS THE LATE SENATOR GEORGE, LONG CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE AND ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, SAID: \"THERE HAS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE YEARS A FEELING BOTH IN AND OUT OF CONGRESS THAT THE CONTRIBUTORY SOCIAL INSURANCE PRINCIPLE FITS OUR TIMES - THAT IT SERVES A VITAL NEED THAT CANNOT BE AS WELL SERVED OTHERWISE. IT COMPORTS BETTER THAN ANY SUBSTITUTE WE HAVE DISCOVERED WITH THE AMERICAN CONCEPT THAT FREE MEN WANT TO EARN THEIR SECURITY AND NOT ASK FOR DOLES - THAT WHAT IS DUE AS A MATTER OF EARNED RIGHT IS FAR BETTER THAN A GRATUITY ... \"SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT A HANDOUT; IT IS NOT CHARITY; IT IS NOT RELIEF. IT IS AN EARNED RIGHT BASED UPON THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. AS AN EARNED RIGHT, THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE HIS BENEFIT IN DIGNITY AND SELF-RESPECT.\" 102 CONG. REC. 15110. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS HAVE RIGHTLY COME TO BE REGARDED AS BASIC FINANCIAL PROTECTION AGAINST THE HAZARDS OF OLD AGE AND DISABILITY. AS STATED IN A RECENT HOUSE REPORT: \"THE OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE SYSTEM IS THE BASIC PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR AMERICA'S FAMILIES AGAINST THE LOSS OF EARNED INCOME UPON THE RETIREMENT OR DEATH OF THE FAMILY PROVIDER. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES BENEFITS RELATED TO EARNED INCOME AND SUCH BENEFITS ARE PAID FOR BY THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO PERSONS WORKING IN COVERED OCCUPATIONS.\" H.R. REP. NO. 1189, 84TH CONG., 1ST SESS. 2. CONGRESS COULD PROVIDE THAT ONLY PEOPLE RESIDENT HERE COULD GET SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. YET BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE REJECTED ANY RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS. SEE H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 24-25; S. REP. NO. 1987, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 23. CONGRESS CONCEDEDLY MIGHT AMEND THE PROGRAM TO MEET NEW CONDITIONS. BUT MAY IT TAKE AWAY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS FROM ONE PERSON OR FROM A GROUP OF PERSONS FOR VINDICTIVE REASONS? COULD CONGRESS ON DEPORTING AN ALIEN FOR HAVING BEEN A COMMUNIST CONFISCATE HIS HOME, APPROPRIATE HIS SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, AND THUS SEND HIM OUT OF THE COUNTRY PENNILESS? I THINK NOT. ANY SUCH ACT WOULD BE A BILL OF ATTAINDER. THE DIFFERENCE, AS I SEE IT, BETWEEN THAT CASE AND THIS IS ONE MERELY OF DEGREE. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, MADE UP IN PART OF THIS ALIEN'S OWN EARNINGS, ARE TAKEN FROM HIM BECAUSE HE ONCE WAS A COMMUNIST. THE VIEW THAT SEC. 202(N), WITH WHICH WE NOW DEAL, IMPOSES A PENALTY WAS TAKEN BY SECRETARY FOLSOM, APPELLANT'S PREDECESSOR, WHEN OPPOSING ENLARGEMENT OF THE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE TO BE DENIED BENEFITS OF SOCIAL SECURITY, E.G., THOSE CONVICTED OF TREASON AND SEDITION. HE SAID: \"BECAUSE THE DEPRIVATION OF BENEFITS AS PROVIDED IN THE AMENDMENT IS IN THE NATURE OF A PENALTY AND BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS FOREIGN TO THE OBJECTIVES AND PROVISIONS OF THE OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE PROGRAM, THE AMENDMENT MAY WELL SERVE AS A PRECEDENT FOR EXTENSION OF SIMILAR PROVISIONS TO OTHER PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND TO OTHER CRIMES WHICH, WHILE PERHAPS DIFFERENT IN DEGREE, ARE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH IN PRINCIPLE. \"THE PRESENT LAW RECOGNIZES ONLY THREE NARROWLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS (FN3) TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT BENEFITS ARE PAID WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ATTITUDES, OPINIONS, BEHAVIOR, OR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ... .\" HEARINGS, SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1955, 84TH CONG., 2D SESS. 1319. THE COMMITTEE REPORTS, THOUGH MEAGRE, SUPPORT SECRETARY FOLSOM IN THAT CHARACTERIZATION OF SEC. 202(N). THE HOUSE REPORT TERSELY STATED THAT TERMINATION OF THE BENEFITS WOULD APPLY TO THOSE PERSONS WHO WERE DEPORTED \"BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY.\" H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 25. THE AIM AND PURPOSE ARE CLEAR - TO TAKE AWAY FROM A PERSON BY LEGISLATIVE FIAT PROPERTY WHICH HE HAS ACCUMULATED BECAUSE HE HAS ACTED IN A CERTAIN WAY OR EMBRACED A CERTAIN IDEOLOGY. THAT IS A MODERN VERSION OF THE BILL OF ATTAINDER - AS PLAIN, AS DIRECT, AS EFFECTIVE AS THOSE WHICH RELIGIOUS PASSIONS ONCE LOOSED IN ENGLAND AND WHICH LATER WERE EMPLOYED AGAINST THE TORIES HERE. (FN4) I WOULD AFFIRM THIS JUDGMENT. FOOTNOTES Footnote 1- ADDRESS ENTITLED BILLS OF ATTAINDER IN 1787 AND TODAY. COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW DINNER 1954, PUBLISHED IN 1959 BY THE EMERGENCY CIVIL LIBERTIES COMMITTEE, UNDER THE TITLE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND BILLS OF ATTAINDER. Footnote 2- THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE IDEA OF PUNISHMENT BEHIND THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL OF ATTAINDER WAS STATED AS FOLLOWS BY IRVING BRANT, OP. CIT., SUPRA, NOTE 1, 9-10: \"IN 1794 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT COMPARABLE TO THAT WHICH EXISTS TODAY. SUPPORTERS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAD ORGANIZED THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES - BLATANTLY ADOPTING THAT SUBVERSIVE TITLE. THEN THE WHISKY REBELLION EXPLODED IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES WERE BLAMED. A MOTION CENSURING THE SOCIETIES WAS INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. \"THERE, IN 1794, YOU HAD THE BASIC DIVISION IN AMERICAN THOUGHT - ON ONE SIDE THE DOCTRINE OF POLITICAL LIBERTY FOR EVERYBODY, WITH COLLECTIVE SECURITY RESTING ON THE CAPACITY OF THE PEOPLE FOR SELF GOVERNMENT; ON THE OTHER SIDE THE DOCTRINE THAT THE PEOPLE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED AND POLITICAL LIBERTY MUST BE RESTRAINED. \"JAMES MADISON CHALLENGED THIS LATTER DOCTRINE. THE INVESTIGATIVE POWER OF CONGRESS OVER PERSONS, HE CONTENDED, WAS LIMITED TO INQUIRY INTO THE CONDUCT OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE. 'OPINIONS,' HE SAID, 'ARE NOT THE SUBJECTS OF LEGISLATION.' START CRITICIZING PEOPLE FOR ABUSE OF THEIR RESERVED RIGHTS, AND THE CENSURE MIGHT EXTEND TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS. WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT ON THE PEOPLE THUS CONDEMNED? SAID MADISON: \"'IT IS IN VAIN TO SAY THAT THIS INDISCRIMINATE CENSURE IS NO PUNISHMENT ... . IS NOT THIS PROPOSITION, IF VOTED, A BILL OF ATTAINDER?' \"MADISON WON HIS FIGHT, NOT BECAUSE HE CALLED THE RESOLUTION A BILL OF ATTAINDER, BUT BECAUSE IT ATTAINTED TOO MANY MEN WHO WERE GOING TO VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION. THE DEFINITION, HOWEVER, WAS THERE - A BILL OF ATTAINDER - AND THE DEFINITION WAS GIVEN BY THE FOREMOST AMERICAN AUTHORITY ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND ORDER UNDERLYING OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.\" Footnote 3- THE THREE EXCEPTIONS REFERRED TO WERE (1) SEC. 202(N); (2) ACT OF SEPTEMBER 1, 1954, 68 STAT. 1142, 5 U.S.C. SECS. 2281-2288; (3) REGULATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, 20 CFR SEC. 403.409 - DENYING DEPENDENT'S BENEFITS TO A PERSON FOUND GUILTY OF FELONIOUS HOMICIDE OF THE INSURED WORKER. Footnote 4- BRANT, OP. CIT., SUPRA, NOTE 1, STATES AT P. 9: \"WHAT WERE THE FRAMERS AIMING AT WHEN THEY FORBADE BILLS OF ATTAINDER? THEY WERE, OF COURSE, GUARDING AGAINST THE RELIGIOUS PASSIONS THAT DISGRACED CHRISTIANITY IN EUROPE. BUT AMERICAN BILLS OF ATTAINDER, JUST BEFORE 1787, WERE TYPICALLY USED BY REVOLUTIONARY ASSEMBLIES TO RID THE STATES OF BRITISH LOYALISTS. BY A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE, IT WAS USUALLY THE TORY WITH A GOOD FARM WHO WAS SENT INTO EXILE, AND ALL TOO OFTEN IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO WANTED THAT FARM WHO INDUCED THE LEGISLATURE TO ATTAINT HIM. PATRIOTISM COULD SERVE AS A CLOAK FOR GREED AS EASILY AS RELIGION DID IN THAT IRISH PARLIAMENT OF JAMES THE SECOND. \"BUT CONSIDER A CASE IN WHICH NOTHING COULD BE SAID AGAINST THE MOTIVE. DURING THE REVOLUTION, GOVERNOR PATRICK HENRY INDUCED THE VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE TO PASS A BILL OF ATTAINDER CONDEMNING JOSIAH PHILLIPS TO DEATH. HE WAS A TRAITOR, A MURDERER, A PIRATE AND AN OUTLAW. WHEN RATIFICATION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION CAME BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION, HENRY INVEIGHED AGAINST IT BECAUSE IT CONTAINED NO BILL OF RIGHTS. EDMUND RANDOLPH TAUNTED HIM WITH HIS SPONSORSHIP OF THE PHILLIPS BILL OF ATTAINDER. HENRY THEN MADE THE BLUNDER OF DEFENDING IT. THE BILL WAS WARRANTED, HE SAID, BECAUSE PHILLIPS WAS NO SOCRATES. THAT SHOCKING DEFENSE OF ARBITRARY CONDEMNATION MAY HAVE PRODUCED THE SMALL MARGIN BY WHICH THE CONSTITUTION WAS RATIFIED.\" MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, WITH WHOM THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS JOIN, DISSENTING. WHEN NESTOR QUIT THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN 1939 HIS PAST MEMBERSHIP WAS NOT A GROUND FOR HIS DEPORTATION. KESSLER V. STRECKER, 307 U.S. 22. IT WAS NOT UNTIL A YEAR LATER THAT PAST MEMBERSHIP WAS MADE A SPECIFIC GROUND FOR DEPORTATION. (FN1) THIS PAST MEMBERSHIP HAS COST NESTOR DEAR. IT BROUGHT HIM EXPULSION FROM THE COUNTRY AFTER 43 YEARS' RESIDENCE - MOST OF HIS LIFE. NOW MORE IS EXACTED FROM HIM, FOR AFTER HE HAD BEGUN TO RECEIVE BENEFITS IN 1955 - HAVING WORKED IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT THE REQUIRED TIME AND REACHED AGE 65 - AND MIGHT ANTICIPATE RECEIVING THEM THE REST OF HIS LIFE, THE BENEFITS WERE STOPPED PURSUANT TO SEC. 202(N) OF THE AMENDED SOCIAL SECURITY ACT. (FN2) HIS PREDICAMENT IS VERY REAL - AN AGING MAN DEPRIVED OF THE MEANS WITH WHICH TO LIVE AFTER BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY AND EXILED TO LIVE AMONG STRANGERS IN A LAND HE QUIT 47 YEARS AGO. THE COMMON SENSE OF IT IS THAT HE HAS BEEN PUNISHED SEVERELY FOR HIS PAST CONDUCT. EVEN THE 1950 STATUTE DEPORTING ALIENS FOR PAST MEMBERSHIP RAISED SERIOUS QUESTIONS IN THIS COURT WHETHER THE PROHIBITION AGAINST EX POST FACTO LAWS WAS VIOLATED. IN GALVAN V. PRESS, 347 U.S. 522, 531, WE SAID \"SINCE THE INTRINSIC CONSEQUENCES OF DEPORTATION ARE SO CLOSE TO PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME, IT MIGHT FAIRLY BE SAID ALSO THAT THE EX POST FACTO CLAUSE, EVEN THOUGH APPLICABLE ONLY TO PUNITIVE LEGISLATION, SHOULD BE APPLIED TO DEPORTATION.\" HOWEVER, PRECEDENTS WHICH TREAT DEPORTATION NOT AS PUNISHMENT, BUT AS A PERMISSIBLE EXERCISE OF CONGRESSIONAL POWER TO ENACT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ALIENS MAY COME TO AND REMAIN IN THIS COUNTRY, GOVERNED THE DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATUTE. HOWEVER, THE COURT CANNOT REST A DECISION THAT SEC. 202(N) DOES NOT IMPOSE PUNISHMENT ON CONGRESS' POWER TO REGULATE IMMIGRATION. IT ESCAPES THE COMMON-SENSE CONCLUSION THAT CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED PUNISHMENT BY FINDING THE REQUISITE RATIONAL NEXUS TO A GRANTED POWER IN THE SUPPOSED FURTHERANCE OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM \"ENACTED PURSUANT TO CONGRESS' POWER TO 'SPEND MONEY IN AID OF THE \"GENERAL WELFARE.\"'\" I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE COURT TO DENY THAT BUT FOR THAT CONNECTION, SEC. 202(N) WOULD IMPOSE PUNISHMENT AND NOT ONLY OFFEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION ON EX POST FACTO LAWS BUT ALSO VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES AGAINST IMPOSITION OF PUNISHMENT WITHOUT A JUDICIAL TRIAL. THE COURT'S TEST OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEC. 202(N) IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE CONCERN UNDERLYING THE STATUTE WAS TO REGULATE \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED\" OR WHETHER THE STATUTE \"IS EVIDENTLY AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" IT REJECTS THE INFERENCE THAT THE STATUTE IS \"AIMED AT THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED\" BY RELYING UPON THE PRESUMPTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY. THIS PRESUMPTION MIGHT BE A BASIS FOR SUSTAINING THE STATUTE IF IN FACT THERE WERE TWO OPPOSING INFERENCES WHICH COULD REASONABLY BE DRAWN FROM THE LEGISLATION, ONE THAT IT IMPOSES PUNISHMENT AND THE OTHER THAT IT IS PURPOSED TO FURTHER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. THE COURT, HOWEVER, DOES NOT LIMIT THE PRESUMPTION TO THAT USE. RATHER THE PRESUMPTION BECOMES A COMPLETE SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY SUPPORTABLE FINDING OF A RATIONAL CONNECTION OF SEC. 202(N) WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. FOR ME IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO STATE THE TEST AND HOLD THAT THE PRESUMPTION ALONE SATISFIES IT. I FIND IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE ACT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THERE IS GROUND FOR THE INFERENCE OF A CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM. ONLY AFTER THIS INQUIRY WOULD I CONSIDER THE APPLICATION OF THE PRESUMPTION. THE COURT SEEMS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STATUTE BEARS HARSHLY UPON THE INDIVIDUAL DISQUALIFIED, BUT STATES THAT THIS IS PERMISSIBLE WHEN A STATUTE IS ENACTED AS A REGULATION OF THE ACTIVITY. BUT SURELY THE HARSHNESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES IS ITSELF A RELEVANT CONSIDERATION TO THE INQUIRY INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL PURPOSE. (FN3) CF. TROP V. DULLES, 356 U.S. 86, 110 (CONCURRING OPINION). IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE STATUTE ITSELF SHOWS THAT THE SOLE LEGISLATIVE CONCERN WAS WITH \"THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" CONGRESS DID NOT DISQUALIFY FOR BENEFITS ALL BENEFICIARIES RESIDING ABROAD OR EVEN ALL DEPENDENTS RESIDING ABROAD WHO ARE ALIENS. IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE I MIGHT AGREE THAT CONGRESS' CONCERN WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS\" AND NOT WITH THE \"PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" THE SCALES WOULD THEN BE TIPPED TOWARD THE CONCLUSION THAT CONGRESS DESIRED TO LIMIT BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO BENEFICIARIES RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES SO THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WOULD BE AIDED BY EXPENDITURE OF BENEFITS HERE. INDEED A PROPOSAL ALONG THOSE LINES WAS SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS IN 1954, AT THE SAME TIME SEC. 202(N) WAS PROPOSED, (FN4) AND IT WAS REJECTED. (FN5) PERHAPS, THE COURT'S CONCLUSION THAT REGULATION OF \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS\" WAS THE CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WOULD BE A FAIR APPRAISAL OF THE STATUTE IF CONGRESS HAD TERMINATED THE BENEFITS OF ALL ALIEN BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE DEPORTED. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT CONGRESS DID. THE 18 GROUNDS FOR WHICH ALIENS MAY BE DEPORTED. (FN6) H.R. REP. NO. 1698, 83D CONG., 2D SESS. 25, 77, CITED BY THE COURT, DESCRIBES SEC. 202(N) AS INCLUDING PERSONS WHO WERE DEPORTED \"BECAUSE OF UNLAWFUL ENTRY, CONVICTION OF A CRIME, OR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY.\" THE ACTS AS NARCOTIC ADDICTION OR PROSTITUTION. THE COMMON ELEMENT OF THE 14 GROUNDS IS THAT THE ALIEN HAS BEEN GUILTY OF SOME BLAMEWORTHY CONDUCT. IN OTHER WORDS CONGRESS WORKED ITS WILL ONLY ON ALIENS DEPORTED FOR CONDUCT DISPLEASING TO THE LAWMAKERS. THIS IS PLAINLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE REMAINING FOUR GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION, THOSE WHICH DO NOT RESULT IN THE CANCELLATION OF BENEFITS. (FN7) TWO OF THOSE FOUR GROUNDS COVER PERSONS WHO BECOME PUBLIC CHARGES WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY FOR REASONS WHICH PREDATED THE ENTRY. A THIRD GROUND COVERS THE ALIEN WHO FAILS TO MAINTAIN HIS NONIMMIGRANT STATUS. THE FOURTH GROUND REACHES THE ALIEN WHO, PRIOR TO OR WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY, AIDS OTHER ALIENS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. THOSE WHO ARE DEPORTED FOR BECOMING PUBLIC CHARGES CLEARLY HAVE NOT, BY MODERN STANDARDS, ENGAGED IN CONDUCT WORTHY OF CENSURE. THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT THE REASON FOR THEIR EXCLUSION FROM SEC. 202(N) WAS AN UNARTICULATED FEELING OF CONGRESS THAT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO THE \"OTHER COUNTRY TO DEPORT SUCH DESTITUTE PERSONS WITHOUT LETTING THEM RETAIN THEIR MODICUM OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS\" APPEARS AT BEST FANCIFUL, ESPECIALLY SINCE, BY HYPOTHESIS, THEY ARE DEPORTABLE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO THEIR BECOMING PUBLIC CHARGES EXISTED PRIOR TO ENTRY. THE EXCLUSION FROM THE OPERATION OF SEC. 202(N) OF ALIENS DEPORTED FOR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN NONIMMIGRANT STATUS RATIONALLY CAN BE EXPLAINED, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE STATUTE, ONLY AS EVIDENCING THAT CONGRESS CONSIDERED THAT CONDUCT LESS BLAMEWORTHY. CERTAINLY THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT CONGRESS MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY THAT SUCH PERSONS WOULD WORK SUFFICIENT TIME IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS CANNOT BE THE REASON FOR THIS EXCLUSION. FOR FREQUENTLY THE VERY ACT WHICH EVENTUALLY RESULTS IN THE DEPORTATION OF PERSONS ON THAT GROUND IS THE SECURING OF PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT. FINALLY, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONCILE THE CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS TO ALIENS WHO ARE DEPORTED FOR AIDING OTHER ALIENS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, EXCEPT UPON THE GROUND THAT CONGRESS FELT THAT THEIR CONDUCT WAS LESS REPREHENSIBLE. AGAIN THE GOVERNMENT'S SUGGESTION THAT THE REASON MIGHT BE CONGRESS' BELIEF THAT THESE ALIENS WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED IN COVERED EMPLOYMENT MUST BE REJECTED. FIVE YEARS AFTER ENTRY WOULD BE AMPLE TIME WITHIN WHICH TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT AND QUALIFY. MOREOVER THE SAME FIVE-YEAR LIMITATION APPLIES TO SEVERAL OF THE 14 GROUNDS OF DEPORTATION FOR WHICH ALIENS ARE CUT OFF FROM BENEFITS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S ARGUMENT WOULD APPLY EQUALLY TO THEM IF THAT IN FACT WAS THE CONGRESSIONAL REASON. THIS APPRAISAL OF THE DISTINCTIONS DRAWN BY CONGRESS BETWEEN VARIOUS KINDS OF CONDUCT IMPELS THE CONCLUSION, BEYOND PERADVENTURE THAT THE DISTINCTIONS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY IF THE PURPOSE OF CONGRESS WAS TO STRIKE AT \"THE PERSON OR CLASS OF PERSONS DISQUALIFIED.\" THE COURT INVEIGHS AGAINST INVALIDATING A STATUTE ON \"IMPLICATON AND VAGUE CONJECTURE.\" RATHER I THINK THE COURT HAS STRAINED TO SUSTAIN THE STATUTE ON \"IMPLICATION AND VAGUE CONJECTURE,\" IN HOLDING THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL CONCERN WAS \"THE ACTIVITY OR STATUS FROM WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS BARRED.\" TODAY'S DECISION SANCTIONS THE USE OF THE SPENDING POWER NOT TO FURTHER THE LEGITIMATE OBJECTIVES OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM BUT TO INFLICT HURT UPON THOSE WHO BY THEIR CONDUCT HAVE INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF CONGRESS. THE FRAMERS ORDAINED THAT EVEN THE WORST OF MEN SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR THEIR PAST ACTS OR FOR ANY CONDUCT WITHOUT ADHERENCE TO THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS WRITTEN INTO THE CONSTITUTION. TODAY'S DECISION IS TO ME A REGRETFUL RETREAT FROM LOVETT, CUMMINGS AND GARLAND.  \n",

Workers leave the site of the future Trump International Hotel, which is at the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels.But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project — billionaire developer Donald Trump — put himself at the center of the nation’s debate over illegal immigration.[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]Trump garnered headlines — and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him — when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and “rapists” crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump’s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs — while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments.

He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.“The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,” Arellano said in Spanish. “And we’re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.”Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.“Most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,” said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country’s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.“He might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,” Gonzalez said of Trump.1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York.

A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.”In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers.“Our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,” the ­e-mailed statement said.Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, “requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,” the statement said.Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.“Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,” Cohen said in a telephone interview. “That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.”A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.Hicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump’s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.Trump’s comments about illegal immigration — which included a promise to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and bill Mexico for the cost — reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company’s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.The rapid rejection of Trump’s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.Trump’s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country — and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul’s remarks.The NBC television network, the Macy’s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump — part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to “dump Trump” by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump’s hotel.[Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to ‘dump Trump’]At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump’s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel’s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington — with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building’s heyday as the District’s main post office in the early 20th century.Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. “Most of the workers here are migrants,” he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: “I don’t think it’s right, what he said. They’re hard workers.”For David Montoya, 28, Trump’s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. “Every 18 months, I have to get it renewed,” he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story — one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off — is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.“Actually,” he reflected, “we’re more American than him.”  \n",

Solis)Note: This is a guest post by Justin Levitt, a professor at the Loyola Law School, Los Angeles and an expert in constitutional law and the law of democracy, with a particular focus on election administration and redistricting.Voter ID laws are back in the news once again, with two new opinions from the Wisconsin Supreme Court late last week dealing with the state's ID requirement, which would allow people to vote only if they provide certain forms of government-issued ID. The Court made some minor changes to the law but otherwise upheld it. However, the ID requirement is still on hold pending a federal lawsuit.Part of this litigation — and any rational debate about the issue generally — hinges on two things: costs and benefits. The costs of these sorts of laws vary, because the laws themselves differ from state to state (some are far more burdensome than others). The ostensible benefits, though, are all the same. And in addressing these purported benefits, the Wisconsin Supreme Court blew it. Twice.First, the court cited the idea that ID laws could enhance public confidence--that is, in theory, the laws might make us feel better about elections in that they might provide some security theater. It turns out, though, that this effect is hard to spot. People in states with more restrictive ID laws don’t generally feel better about their elections than people in more permissive states. People who think elections are being stolen, and people who think they’re not, each hold on to that opinion no matter what the governing ID rules in their area. The factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair? Whether their preferred candidates win.[Here’s the completely legal way to ‘rig’ an election]Second, the court said that ID laws can help stop fraud. It then cited an example of recent fraud … that ID laws aren’t designed to stop. Specifically, it mentioned a case in which a supporter of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was charged with 13 counts of election fraud, including \"registering to vote in more than one place, voting where he didn't live, voting more than once in the same election, and providing false information to election officials,\" according to an account by Talking Points Memo. Wisconsin's ID law would not likely have prevented any of the alleged violations.This sort of misdirection is pretty common, actually. Election fraud happens. But ID laws are not aimed at the fraud you’ll actually hear about. Most current ID laws (Wisconsin is a rare exception) aren’t designed to stop fraud with absentee ballots (indeed, laws requiring ID at the polls push more people into the absentee system, where there are plenty of real dangers). Or vote buying. Or coercion. Or fake registration forms. Or voting from the wrong address. Or ballot box stuffing by officials in on the scam. In the 243-page document that Mississippi State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed on Monday with evidence of allegedly illegal votes in the Mississippi Republican primary, there were no allegations of the kind of fraud that ID can stop.Instead, requirements to show ID at the polls are designed for pretty much one thing: people showing up at the polls pretending to be somebody else in order to each cast one incremental fake ballot. This is a slow, clunky way to steal an election. Which is why it rarely happens.I’ve been tracking allegations of fraud for years now, including the fraud ID laws are designed to stop. In 2008, when the Supreme Court weighed in on voter ID, I looked at every single allegation put before the Court. And since then, I’ve been following reports wherever they crop up.[New evidence that voter ID laws 'skew democracy' in favor of white Republicans]To be clear, I’m not just talking about prosecutions. I track any specific, credible allegation that someone may have pretended to be someone else at the polls, in any way that an ID law could fix.So far, I’ve found about 31 different incidents (some of which involve multiple ballots) since 2000, anywhere in the country. If you want to check my work, you can read a comprehensive list of the incidents below.To put this in perspective, the 31 incidents below come in the context of general, primary, special, and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014. In general and primary elections alone, more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period.Some of these 31 incidents have been thoroughly investigated (including some prosecutions). But many have not. Based on how other claims have turned out, I’d bet that some of the 31 will end up debunked: a problem with matching people from one big computer list to another, or a data entry error, or confusion between two different people with the same name, or someone signing in on the wrong line of a pollbook.In just four states that have held just a few elections under the harshest ID laws, more than 3,000 votes (in general elections alone) have reportedly been affirmatively rejected for lack of ID. (That doesn’t include voters without ID who didn’t show up, or recordkeeping mistakes by officials.) Some of those 3,000 may have been fraudulent ballots. But how many legitimate voters have already been turned away?Correction: Justin Levitt is a professor with Loyola Law School, Los Angeles; not the Loyola University Law School.Credible allegations of potential fraud since 2000 that might have been prevented by a rule requiring ID at the pollsNote: tracking the allegations — even those that may end up disproven — can help calibrate an upper bound for the actual existing fraud that ID laws would stop. I am a researcher, and so I am interested in a thorough list: if you have credible information about a specific individual whose vote was stolen by an impersonator at the polls, please tell me. Specific and credible means just that. Not — please — examples like this. And if you have information about an incident below that indicates that it was error rather than fraud, please tell me that as well.May 2014: Ben Hodzic allegedly voted at the polls in the name of his brother in the Catskill School District Board of Education election in Catskill, NY.[1] Nov. 2013: Mark Atlas allegedly voted at the polls in the name of someone else in the municipal election in Worcester, MA.[2] Sep. 2013: At least four, and possibly 20-24, Hasidic voters in the South Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, allegedly attempted to vote at the polls under others’ names in the municipal primary elections for New York City.[3] Mar. 2013: Kristina Bentrim went to vote at the polls in the Cedar Rapids, IA, special election on a gambling referendum, and was allegedly told that someone had voted in her name.[4] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Angela Cooney in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Angela Cooney listed as dying 4 years earlier.[5] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Evan Dixon in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Evan Dixon listed as dying 11 years earlier.[6] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Alejandro Guerrero in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is an Alejandro Guerrero listed as dying 5 years earlier.[7] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. 2012: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2012 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney.[8] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. June 2011: Hazel Brionne Woodard apparently arranged for her son Mark James Jr. to vote at the polls in the name of his father, Mark James Sr., in the municipal runoff elections in Tarrant County, TX.[9] Nov. 2010: Four ballots may have been cast in the general election in South Carolina in the name of voters who had previously died (Ed Louis Johnson, Elbert R. Thompson, Ruth Middleton, and James L. Warnock); election and law enforcement officials had insufficient information to come to a final conclusion, including two pollbook pages that were unavailable. (Law enforcement agents believe that the ballot of Elbert R. Thompson may have been confused with that of his son, Elbert Thompson.) Another 203 allegations of deceased voters in the same election were revealed to be either clerical error or coincidence.[10] May 2009: Lorenzo Antonio Almanza, Jr., after voting himself, apparently cast a ballot at the polls in the name of his incarcerated brother, Orlando Almanza, in the 2009 election for the Progreso Independent School District Board, TX. (His mother, Reyna Almanza, vouched for him, and was separately convicted.)[11] Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Forrest Downie in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Forrest Downie listed as dying 3 years earlier.[12] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2008: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Scott Hagloch in the general election in San Diego, CA; there is a Scott Hagloch listed as dying 2 years earlier.[13] It is not clear whether the two are the same person, or whether the death reports are accurate, and poll book records do not appear to have been investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Mar. 2008: Jack Carol Crowder III allegedly impersonated his father (Jack Carol Crowder), using his father’s voter registration card at the polls in the March 2008 presidential primary election in Baytown, TX.[14] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of James E. Barnes, who died in 2006. This may (or may not) have been the result of clerical error confusing the man with his son, James W. Barnes; it is not clear whether the pollbooks were reviewed to determine whether fraud or clerical error was the cause.[15] Aug. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the statewide primary in Hattiesburg, MS, in the name of Stanley Dwayne Echols, who was at the hospital and did not vote.[16] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. June 2007: The two contending city council candidates in a municipal runoff election in Hoboken, NJ, both reported instances in the election in which someone went to the polls and found out that someone else had voted in their place.[17] It is not clear how many instances there were, or how the candidates learned of them. It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2007: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in a municipal budget referendum in Stonington, CT, in the name of Jane M. Drury, who died in 2000.[18] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Rosalie B. Simpson died in August 2004, but a vote was apparently recorded at the polls in her name in the general election in Seattle, WA.[19] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Frank Sanchez, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[20] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Someone apparently signed on the pollbook line for Rose-Mary G. McGee, in Albuquerque, NM, during the general election.[21] Nov. 2004: Dwight Adkins, in Albuquerque, NM, was told that someone had signed on the line for his name in the pollbook during the general election.[22] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error. Nov. 2004: Three people at the polls in Westchester County, NY, were given provisional ballots (in New York, “affidavit ballots”) in the general election because someone had allegedly signed the poll books in their place.[23] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. Nov. 2004: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the general election in Milwaukee, WI, in the name of an individual who had died several years earlier.[24] It is not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the records of voting represented impersonated signatures or clerical errors. 2004: According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, one allegation of impersonation fraud in 2004 was sufficiently credible to refer to the local district attorney. [25] It is not clear whether the alleged fraud was in-person, or if follow-up established whether fraud did or did not likely occur. Jan. 2004: Mark Lacasse apparently voted at the polls in the presidential primary in Londonderry, NH, in the name of his father, who was away on business at the time. [26] Nov. 2002: Shasta Nicole Crayton apparently voted in her sister’s name at the polls in the general election in Dadeville, AL.[27] In several municipal, primary, and general elections in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011, votes were cast in-person in Philadephia, PA, by an individual named Joseph Cheeseboro and by an individual named Joseph J. Cheeseborough. There is apparently some doubt about where one or both names represent real identities.[28] In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 44 individuals with names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers matching the information of individuals listed as incarcerated were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[29] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the incarceration records or the voting records. In elections from October 2008 through June 2011, 145 individuals with names, dates of birth, and addresses matching the information of individuals listed as deceased were recorded as having cast ballots in person in Michigan.[30] It is not clear whether records were further investigated to determine whether the matches represent fraudulent votes or clerical errors in either the death records or the voting records. According to Texas Director of Elections Keith Ingram, the names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of four “recent” voters allegedly matched the corresponding information on earlier death certificates, indicating that the votes were cast after the individuals’ deaths. It is not clear at which elections these votes were cast, or how many, if any, of these votes were cast at the polls (rather than absentee). It is also not clear whether poll book records were investigated to determine whether the record of voting represented an impersonated signature or a clerical error.[31]Credible allegations of impersonation at the polls since 2000 that would not likely be prevented by a rule requiring ID at the polls, or attempted impersonation at the polls since 2000 that was actually prevented without a strict ID requirement(Note: these allegations do not include other forms of fraud not prevented by a requirement to show ID at the polls, including absentee ballot fraud, vote buying, vote coercion, fraud in the tallying process, voter registration fraud, double voting, voting by nonresidents, voting by noncitizens, voting by persons disenfranchised by conviction, or fraud in the petitioning process.)Nov. 2012: Linda Earlette Wells apparently voted at the polls in the general election in Germantown, MD, in the name of her mother (Beatrice Moore Wells), who had died in June 2011. She apparently used her mother’s ID to cast the ballot.[32] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2012: A vote was apparently cast at the polls in the name of Caitlin A. Legacki in the general election; Legacki was in Missouri at the time. However, in 2012, New Hampshire had a requirement that voters show photo ID at the polls; officials believe that either someone showed a fraudulent ID in Legacki’s name or (according to them, more likely) that a clerical error incorrectly listed Legacki as voting.[33] Nov. 2010 (and Nov. 2008): Ortencia Segura-Segura apparently voted at the polls in the name of Marisela Reyna in the general elections in Reno, NV, using a fraudulently procured Nevada driver’s license.[34] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Mar. 2010: Delores McMillian and her mother were both election officials in Dallas. During the primary election, McMillian used one other voter’s registration number to try to cast a ballot in her name. (Her mother may have used more, but died during the course of the investigation.) A fellow election worker apparently blocked the attempt.[35] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. Nov. 2008 (and others): Mary Ann Comparin used a fake driver’s license in the name of her long-dead sister, Norma Gerrish Collins, to vote in her sister’s name in the 2008 general election in Bexar County, TX. [36] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2008: Ricardo Lopez-Munguia apparently voted (whether absentee or in person is not clear) in the name of Gustavo Carranza-Madrigal in the general election in Escondido, CA. Lopez-Munguia possessed a fraudulent California driver’s license.[37] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from using a fraudulent driver’s license to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: Andrea Peña was apparently recruited by mayor Omar Vela to vote in the school board election in Progreso, TX; Peña was apparently given someone else’s voter registration card and told that pollworkers would make sure there were no problems. An election judge (more usually known as a pollworker) actually cast Peña’s ballot for her.[38] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. May 2008: in the same Progreso school board election, Jessica Rangel claimed that Guadalupe Vela Sr. tried to convince Rangel to recruit a friend to vote with someone else’s voter registration card, and claimed that “they had people that worked the election on their side.” Rangel apparently refused.[39] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Aug. 2007: Vancy Voorhies, a pollworker in Davidson County, TN, apparently voted at the polls in the mayoral election; at her ill elderly cousin’s request, she signed her cousin’s name in the pollbook (with her own initials to indicate the permission), asked her cousin how she preferred to vote, and cast the ballot accordingly.[40] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a misguided pollworker from casting invalid ballots. June 2007: A homeless man was apparently paid $10 to use the name of Kevin Logan to vote in a city council runoff race in Hoboken, NJ. After a challenge by a local resident, the effort failed. [41] Sept. 2005: Memphis, TN, pollworkers Verline Mayo, Gertrude Otteridge, and Mary McClatcher apparently cast at least three votes at the polls in the names of others, including two in the names of dead voters, in a special election for a state Senate seat.[42] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal pollworker from casting invalid ballots. May 2005: Macon, MS, resident Kendrick Slaughter testified that he saw Ike Brown, chairman of the Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee, urging Bridgette Brown to “go in [to the precinct pollsite] and vote, to use any name, and that no one was going to say anything.” It is not clear whether Bridgette Brown did cast a vote at the polls in the name of another, but it is clear that pollworkers under Ike Brown’s direction stood ready to commit or facilitate other forms of voter fraud.[43] It is not clear how a law requiring voters to show ID to pollworkers at the polls could stop a criminal from conspiring with pollworkers to cast invalid ballots. Nov. 2000: A vote was cast in the general election in Miami, FL, in the name of Andre Alismé, who had died in 1997. The voter apparently used either a passport or driver’s license and a voter registration card in Alismé’s name.[44][1] Jim Planck, Alleged Fraud Casts Pall Over Catskill School Vote, Daily Mail, May 29, 2014.[2] Alli Knothe, 2 Charged with Voter Fraud in Worcester, Worcester Telegram & Gazette, Dec. 4, 2013.[3] Max Rivlin-Nadler et al., Brazen Voting Fraud Alleged Among Ultra-Orthodox in Williamsburg, Gothamist, Sep. 11, 2013, http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/voter_fraud_attempts.php.[4] Jason Noble, Schultz, Many Iowans Still Solidly Back Voter ID Laws, Des Moines Register, Dec. 15, 2013.[5] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[6] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[7] Joel Hoffman, Votes Cast in the Name of 8 More, San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2014.[8] N.C.
